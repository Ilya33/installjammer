2008-11-17  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateComponents.action:
          Code cleanup

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action,
      lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddEnvironmentVariable.action:
          Add Directory to Path and Add Environment Variable will now also
          make the same change to the running installer's environment.

    * lib/BWidget/optiontree.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where double-clicking a check box in an option tree
          would cause the check button to toggle twice, but the command
          wouldn't fire.  This leaves some components in the wrong state.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where going back-and-forth between a custom setup
          component screen could leave the components in an unknown state.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Code cleanup.

2008-11-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/BWidget/dynhelp.tcl:
          Set a max width for help balloons so they don't get too big on the
          screen.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Cleanup a help balloon message.

    * lib/class.tcl, lib/file.tcl:
          Added a new Follow File Links property to file groups.  This
          property tells InstallJammer whether to include file links as files
          or links when building.


2008-11-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * Binaries/HPUX-hppa/installkit:
          New HPUX binary.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Make the default exit code empty so it will use a default based on
          the user interaction.
          
          Fix a bug where any message box in the builder would fail.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a -exitcode option the Exit API.
           Fixed a bug in the GetWidgetPath API where it would get the path of
          an enclosing frame instead of the real widget if a widget was added
          with a label.
           Added a new RollbackInstall API.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Exit with a decent exit code if one was never given to us.

    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/Exit.action,
      lib/Actions/WizardActions/MoveForward.action:
          Fixed bugs in the Exit and Move Forward actions that were caused by
          the new exit code capabilities.  They now both call the proper Exit
          API.


2008-11-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fix a bug in the CopyObject API.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where required components could be unchecked by their
          parent if the parent was unchecked.

    * Binaries/Windows/installkit.com, Binaries/Windows/installkit.exe,
      Binaries/Windows/installkitU.exe, installjammer.com, installjammer.exe:
          New Windows binaries.

      Binaries/HPUX-hppa/Tktable2.9, Binaries/HPUX-hppa/craplzma0.1,
      Binaries/HPUX-hppa/tkdnd1.0:
          Removed AIX, FreeBSD 4, FreeBSD 5 and HPUX as builder platforms. 
          This does not mean these platforms are no longer supported.  It
          means they are no longer supported as GUI builder platforms.  They
          also do not support LZMA compression when building on these
          platforms.

2008-11-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a new CopyObject API call.


2008-11-05  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action:
          Fixed a bug where the Add Widget action could be executed from an
          action group with no pane as its parent.  This would cause a "bad
          window" error.

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Uninstall Leftover Files action

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug where specifying Categories in the Additional Arguments
          of the Install UNIX Shortcut action would cause an error instead of
          working like it should.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where it was impossible to post a message box in a
          silent install.

    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/LaunchWebBrowser.action, lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the Launch Web Browser action where an & in the URL
          would truncate the URL.  This was due to Windows' command-line
          parsing rules.  The new method is to create a URL shortcut in the
          temp directory and then invoke that shortcut to launch the browser.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where error messages in a command-line build were not
          output to stderr as they should be.

    * lib/Actions/FileActions/ReplaceTextInFile.action,
      lib/Actions/FileActions/WriteTextToFile.action:
          Added a new Encoding property to the Replace Text in File and Write
          Text to File actions.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Editable text widgets now tab to the next widget when hitting Tab
          instead of inserting a tab in the text box.  A Control-Tab can be
          used to insert a tab if it's really necessary.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Make Shift-Tab work on text widgets too.

    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/Wait.action:
          Make the Wait action do an update before sleeping.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/AppendTextToWidget.action:
          Added a new Append Text to Widget action.

    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/Exit.action, lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl,
      lib/installapi.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Added a new SetExitCode API.
           Added a new Exit Code property to the Exit action.


2008-10-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/build.tcl, lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed several bugs in the build of zip and tar files.

    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where silent install would still show a progress bar.


2008-10-26  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Try to cleanup open file handles on exit.


2008-10-22  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallWindowsShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Install Windows Shortcut action that would
          prevent it from creating a URL shortcut.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the Encode URL API.  The entire URL was being
          encoded, which would percent-encode the hostname as well as the
          query, which is the wrong thing to do.


2008-10-21  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/unpack.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the new split archives code that was causing split
          archives not to work on non-Windows platforms.


2008-10-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/dobuild.tcl:
          Fix a bug where larger installs would fail even on 64 bit systems.

    * lib/cmdline.tcl, lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where variables defined on the command-line were being
          defined after the control script.  The control script should have
          access to the correct values.
           Fixed a bug where setting platform variables from the command-line
          would not be set properly.  Passing -DExecutable, for example, works
          now.
           The special platforms "tar" and "zip" are now acceptable as
          platforms to enable the tar and zip archive targets.


2008-10-16  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2.10b1 RELEASED ***


2008-10-16  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action,
      lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Make the console progress bar more generic and let the uninstall use
          it.

    * docs/InstallJammer User Guide.pdf, docs/InstallJammer.chm,
      docs/html/128.html, docs/html/129.html, docs/html/FHKeywords.html,
      docs/html/FHSearch.js, docs/html/FHTocTab.js,
      docs/html/ReleaseNotes.html:
          Update documentation.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Update version for release.


2008-10-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * Themes/Classic_Wizard/Install/License.pane,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/CopyFiles.pane,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/License.pane,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/Uninstall/Uninstall.pane:
          Fixed a bug where the default actions to modify button states on the
          License and Copy Files panes were happening after the pane had been
          displayed, which would give the user time to quickly zip by them
          before the buttons were changed.  This change only affects new
          projects.  Older projects will have to be modified to fix this bug.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/class.tcl, lib/dobuild.tcl, lib/file.tcl,
      lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Added a new Build Separate Archives property to all platforms.  This
          property allows installers to be built with files being separate
          archives that are mounted on startup.  This means that the
          installers are no longer one single executable, but it makes it
          possible to avoid some size limitations on 32 bit platforms.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action, lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where file installation would sometimes not reach 100%.
           Added a new progress bar for console installs.  A new Show Console
          Progress property was added to the Install Selected Files action
          which is enabled by default.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/cmdline.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an error during a command-line build would not
          exit with an error code.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          If the project is ignoring missing files, the installer should not
          exit on an error for a missing file.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where symlink'd files were being included in the
          installer instead of a link to the file being created on the target
          machine.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where Move to Pane could not select a pane from the
          uninstall.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/MoveForward.action,
      lib/Actions/WizardActions/MoveToPane.action, lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the Move Forward and Move to Pane actions would
          still execute any remaining actions on the current pane after moving
          forward.  Moving now means that any actions after the move are not
          executed.

    * lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action:
          Added a new Clear Progressive Widget property to the Execute
          External Program action to specify whether the progressive output
          widget should be cleared before the program exits.  The default is
          Yes, which was the previous behavior.


2008-10-09  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an installer that specifically did not allow
          language selection could still get English if the system language
          was such.  This should be addressed further in another version.


2008-10-01  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/install.tcl:
          Fix a bug in the new error handling that would cause an error to
          always happen during installation for some platforms.


2008-09-29  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/JavaActions/LocateJavaRuntime.action:
          Fixed a bug where the Locate Java Runtime action was not accurately
          picking up the paths from the Windows registry.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Fix typo.


2008-09-26  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * README.txt:
          Remove mention of sourceforge from the README.


2008-09-25  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action,
      lib/msgs/installer/en.msg:
          An error during file installation now produces a simple error
          message instead of a detailed error.  <%InstallErrors%> contains the
          full error message.

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action,
      lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddEnvironmentVariable.action:
          Fixed a bug where Add Directory to Path would fail for .cshrc when
          the variable didn't already exist.

          properties.


2008-09-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/install.tcl:

2008-09-19  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the language chosen for the installer was not
          being propagated to the uninstaller correctly.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where editing text properties for languages with a space
          in the name (like Brazilian Portuguese) failed to save the edited
          text correctly.


2008-09-09  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause an error in the builder after
          deleting an object and then coming back to that tab.

      Binaries/Windows/installkit.exe:
          New Windows binaries.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallProgramFolderShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Install Program Folder Shortcut action where
          specifying a subfolder in the folder name would be ignored, and the
          icon would just be installed in the root program folder.

2008-09-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action, lib/common.tcl,
      lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an error during file installation would show an
          error popup and then just freeze with no way to cancel the
          installer.  The error is now returned up the stack to the Install
          Selected Files action where it can be handled.  This also adds a new
          <%InstallErrors%> virtual text that contains the error message from
          the unpack process.

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddEnvironmentVariable.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Add Environment Variable action on Windows where
          the path in the registry would not get expanded for some reason.

          New Linux-x86 binaries.


2008-09-04  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action,
      lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the uninstall process would error if no
          directories were being removed.


2008-08-28  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/commandline.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where building from the command-line would still include
          debug options even when building for release. (thanks to John
          Bratteli for the fix).


2008-08-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the uninstall could exit with an error on cleanup
          when being executed from another uninstall.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/class.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where Windows exe information was not being substituted
          for virtual text when the installer is built.
           Added a new Install Executable Description property to Windows that
          is used as the File Description in the exe properties.  This
          defaults to what it has always been: <%AppName%> <%Version%> Setup.

    * lib/BWidget/properties.tcl, lib/file.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl,
      lib/new.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where editing the Install Version would cause it to roll
          back to 1.0.0.0 each time.
           Fixed a bug where the version variables derived from InstallVersion
          were not being set properly.  Passing version information on the
          command-line should also work as expected now.

    *** InstallJammer 1.2.9 RELEASED ***


2008-08-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug introduced in 1.2.8 where an install registry would not
          get cleaned up properly.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where cleaning up a canceled install could cause errors
          and freeze the installer under certain conditions.

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Fixed a bug where an uninstaller would sometimes report that a
          directory could not be removed because it was not empty when it
          actually was.  This fix now means that directories are not
          necessarily removed in the same order they were installed.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Update version for release.


2008-08-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fix a possible error case when attempting to set file permissions on
          a file that doesn't exist.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where stopping an install might still try to execute
          some further code after things had stopped.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Revert those last two changes in favor of the proper fix.


2008-08-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an error in an action would not get propagated up
          to show an error message.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where a message box in an uninstaller could fail and
          hang without an error.

    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an uninstall that did not have permissions would
          attempt to do a lot of things that just weren't possible.  The
          uninstall should fail gracefully now and give the user proper error
          messages.

    *** InstallJammer 1.2.8 RELEASED ***


2008-08-04  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/CreateWindowsService.action:
          Fix a bug where the Display Name property was being ignored in the
          Create Windows Service action.


2008-08-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where loading a corrupted preferences file would cause a
          crash.  A corrupted preferences file should just be deleted.

    * lib/Actions/ConsoleActions/ConsoleGetUserInput.action,
      lib/Actions/ConsoleActions/ConsolePause.action, lib/common.tcl:
          All calls to the external stty command are now wrapped in a catch to
          prevent failures.  This doesn't mean that stty won't fail, it just
          means that InstallJammer won't fail as a result of it.  This could
          mean that some console actions do not work as expected on some
          systems, but the errors seem to be very limited to a small number of
          machines.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Update version.

    * ANNOUNCE.txt:
          Update announcement.


2008-07-31  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the AND/OR operator for conditions was not
          propagated to temporary objects created during execution.

    * lib/BWidget/choosefile.tcl:
          Fix a bug where selecting a single file in a multi-select file
          chooser would fail if the file selected had a space in the path.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug where a space in the command line of a UNIX shortcut
          would fail because the filename wasn't properly quoted.  Double
          quotes are now added around a command with spaces before writing out
          the shortcut file.


2008-07-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where duplicate directories could show up in file
          groups.

    * lib/Actions/FileActions/WriteTextToFile.action:
          Fix a bug introduced in the last release.  Files in Write Text to
          File that are relative are made relative to the install dir as the
          docs correctly say.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          In debug mode, make the error messages from actions and conditions
          display more information about the error.


2008-11-17  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateComponents.action:
          Code cleanup

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action,
      lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddEnvironmentVariable.action:
          Add Directory to Path and Add Environment Variable will now also
          make the same change to the running installer's environment.

    * lib/BWidget/optiontree.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where double-clicking a check box in an option tree
          would cause the check button to toggle twice, but the command
          wouldn't fire.  This leaves some components in the wrong state.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where going back-and-forth between a custom setup
          component screen could leave the components in an unknown state.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Code cleanup.

2008-11-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/BWidget/dynhelp.tcl:
          Set a max width for help balloons so they don't get too big on the
          screen.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Cleanup a help balloon message.

    * lib/class.tcl, lib/file.tcl:
          Added a new Follow File Links property to file groups.  This
          property tells InstallJammer whether to include file links as files
          or links when building.


2008-11-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * Binaries/HPUX-hppa/installkit:
          New HPUX binary.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Make the default exit code empty so it will use a default based on
          the user interaction.
          
          Fix a bug where any message box in the builder would fail.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a -exitcode option the Exit API.
           Fixed a bug in the GetWidgetPath API where it would get the path of
          an enclosing frame instead of the real widget if a widget was added
          with a label.
           Added a new RollbackInstall API.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Exit with a decent exit code if one was never given to us.

    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/Exit.action,
      lib/Actions/WizardActions/MoveForward.action:
          Fixed bugs in the Exit and Move Forward actions that were caused by
          the new exit code capabilities.  They now both call the proper Exit
          API.


2008-11-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fix a bug in the CopyObject API.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where required components could be unchecked by their
          parent if the parent was unchecked.

    * Binaries/Windows/installkit.com, Binaries/Windows/installkit.exe,
      Binaries/Windows/installkitU.exe, installjammer.com, installjammer.exe:
          New Windows binaries.

      Binaries/HPUX-hppa/Tktable2.9, Binaries/HPUX-hppa/craplzma0.1,
      Binaries/HPUX-hppa/tkdnd1.0:
          Removed AIX, FreeBSD 4, FreeBSD 5 and HPUX as builder platforms. 
          This does not mean these platforms are no longer supported.  It
          means they are no longer supported as GUI builder platforms.  They
          also do not support LZMA compression when building on these
          platforms.

2008-11-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a new CopyObject API call.


2008-11-05  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action:
          Fixed a bug where the Add Widget action could be executed from an
          action group with no pane as its parent.  This would cause a "bad
          window" error.

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Uninstall Leftover Files action

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug where specifying Categories in the Additional Arguments
          of the Install UNIX Shortcut action would cause an error instead of
          working like it should.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where it was impossible to post a message box in a
          silent install.

    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/LaunchWebBrowser.action, lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the Launch Web Browser action where an & in the URL
          would truncate the URL.  This was due to Windows' command-line
          parsing rules.  The new method is to create a URL shortcut in the
          temp directory and then invoke that shortcut to launch the browser.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where error messages in a command-line build were not
          output to stderr as they should be.

    * lib/Actions/FileActions/ReplaceTextInFile.action,
      lib/Actions/FileActions/WriteTextToFile.action:
          Added a new Encoding property to the Replace Text in File and Write
          Text to File actions.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Editable text widgets now tab to the next widget when hitting Tab
          instead of inserting a tab in the text box.  A Control-Tab can be
          used to insert a tab if it's really necessary.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Make Shift-Tab work on text widgets too.

    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/Wait.action:
          Make the Wait action do an update before sleeping.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/AppendTextToWidget.action:
          Added a new Append Text to Widget action.

    * lib/Actions/GeneralActions/Exit.action, lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl,
      lib/installapi.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Added a new SetExitCode API.
           Added a new Exit Code property to the Exit action.


2008-10-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/build.tcl, lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed several bugs in the build of zip and tar files.

    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where silent install would still show a progress bar.


2008-10-26  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Try to cleanup open file handles on exit.


2008-10-22  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallWindowsShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Install Windows Shortcut action that would
          prevent it from creating a URL shortcut.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the Encode URL API.  The entire URL was being
          encoded, which would percent-encode the hostname as well as the
          query, which is the wrong thing to do.


2008-10-21  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/unpack.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the new split archives code that was causing split
          archives not to work on non-Windows platforms.


2008-10-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/dobuild.tcl:
          Fix a bug where larger installs would fail even on 64 bit systems.

    * lib/cmdline.tcl, lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where variables defined on the command-line were being
          defined after the control script.  The control script should have
          access to the correct values.
           Fixed a bug where setting platform variables from the command-line
          would not be set properly.  Passing -DExecutable, for example, works
          now.
           The special platforms "tar" and "zip" are now acceptable as
          platforms to enable the tar and zip archive targets.

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action,
      lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl:

          it.

      docs/html/FHSearch.js, docs/html/FHTocTab.js,

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Update version for release.


2008-10-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * Themes/Classic_Wizard/Install/License.pane,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/CopyFiles.pane,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/License.pane,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/Uninstall/Uninstall.pane:
          Fixed a bug where the default actions to modify button states on the
          License and Copy Files panes were happening after the pane had been
          displayed, which would give the user time to quickly zip by them
          before the buttons were changed.  This change only affects new
          projects.  Older projects will have to be modified to fix this bug.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/class.tcl, lib/dobuild.tcl, lib/file.tcl,
      lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Added a new Build Separate Archives property to all platforms.  This
          property allows installers to be built with files being separate
          archives that are mounted on startup.  This means that the
          installers are no longer one single executable, but it makes it
          possible to avoid some size limitations on 32 bit platforms.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action, lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where file installation would sometimes not reach 100%.
           Added a new progress bar for console installs.  A new Show Console
          Progress property was added to the Install Selected Files action
          which is enabled by default.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/cmdline.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an error during a command-line build would not
          exit with an error code.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          If the project is ignoring missing files, the installer should not
          exit on an error for a missing file.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where symlink'd files were being included in the
          installer instead of a link to the file being created on the target
          machine.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where Move to Pane could not select a pane from the
          uninstall.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/MoveForward.action,
      lib/Actions/WizardActions/MoveToPane.action, lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the Move Forward and Move to Pane actions would
          still execute any remaining actions on the current pane after moving
          forward.  Moving now means that any actions after the move are not
          executed.

    * lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action:
          Added a new Clear Progressive Widget property to the Execute
          External Program action to specify whether the progressive output
          widget should be cleared before the program exits.  The default is
          Yes, which was the previous behavior.


2008-10-09  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an installer that specifically did not allow
          language selection could still get English if the system language
          was such.  This should be addressed further in another version.


2008-10-01  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/install.tcl:
          Fix a bug in the new error handling that would cause an error to
          always happen during installation for some platforms.


2008-09-29  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/JavaActions/LocateJavaRuntime.action:
          Fixed a bug where the Locate Java Runtime action was not accurately
          picking up the paths from the Windows registry.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Fix typo.


2008-09-26  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * README.txt:
          Remove mention of sourceforge from the README.


2008-09-25  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action,
      lib/msgs/installer/en.msg:
          An error during file installation now produces a simple error
          message instead of a detailed error.  <%InstallErrors%> contains the
          full error message.

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action,
      lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddEnvironmentVariable.action:
          Fixed a bug where Add Directory to Path would fail for .cshrc when
          the variable didn't already exist.

          properties.


2008-09-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/install.tcl:

2008-09-19  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the language chosen for the installer was not
          being propagated to the uninstaller correctly.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where editing text properties for languages with a space
          in the name (like Brazilian Portuguese) failed to save the edited
          text correctly.


2008-09-09  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause an error in the builder after
          deleting an object and then coming back to that tab.

2008-09-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action, lib/common.tcl,
      lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an error during file installation would show an
          error popup and then just freeze with no way to cancel the
          installer.  The error is now returned up the stack to the Install
          Selected Files action where it can be handled.  This also adds a new
          <%InstallErrors%> virtual text that contains the error message from
          the unpack process.

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddEnvironmentVariable.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Add Environment Variable action on Windows where
          the path in the registry would not get expanded for some reason.

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action,

          directories were being removed.


2008-08-28  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/commandline.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where building from the command-line would still include
          debug options even when building for release. (thanks to John
          Bratteli for the fix).


2008-08-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the uninstall could exit with an error on cleanup
          when being executed from another uninstall.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/class.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where Windows exe information was not being substituted
          for virtual text when the installer is built.
           Added a new Install Executable Description property to Windows that
          is used as the File Description in the exe properties.  This
          defaults to what it has always been: <%AppName%> <%Version%> Setup.

    * lib/BWidget/properties.tcl, lib/file.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl,
      lib/new.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where editing the Install Version would cause it to roll
          back to 1.0.0.0 each time.
           Fixed a bug where the version variables derived from InstallVersion
          were not being set properly.  Passing version information on the
          command-line should also work as expected now.

    *** InstallJammer 1.2.9 RELEASED ***


2008-08-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug introduced in 1.2.8 where an install registry would not
          get cleaned up properly.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where cleaning up a canceled install could cause errors
          and freeze the installer under certain conditions.

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Fixed a bug where an uninstaller would sometimes report that a
          directory could not be removed because it was not empty when it
          actually was.  This fix now means that directories are not
          necessarily removed in the same order they were installed.

2008-08-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fix a possible error case when attempting to set file permissions on
          a file that doesn't exist.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where stopping an install might still try to execute
          some further code after things had stopped.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Revert those last two changes in favor of the proper fix.


2008-08-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an error in an action would not get propagated up
          to show an error message.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where a message box in an uninstaller could fail and
          hang without an error.

    * lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an uninstall that did not have permissions would
          attempt to do a lot of things that just weren't possible.  The
          uninstall should fail gracefully now and give the user proper error
          messages.

2008-08-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where loading a corrupted preferences file would cause a

    * lib/Actions/ConsoleActions/ConsoleGetUserInput.action,
      lib/Actions/ConsoleActions/ConsolePause.action, lib/common.tcl:
          All calls to the external stty command are now wrapped in a catch to
          prevent failures.  This doesn't mean that stty won't fail, it just
          means that InstallJammer won't fail as a result of it.  This could
          mean that some console actions do not work as expected on some
          systems, but the errors seem to be very limited to a small number of
          machines.

    * ANNOUNCE.txt:
          Update announcement.


2008-07-31  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the AND/OR operator for conditions was not
          propagated to temporary objects created during execution.

    * lib/BWidget/choosefile.tcl:
          Fix a bug where selecting a single file in a multi-select file
          chooser would fail if the file selected had a space in the path.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug where a space in the command line of a UNIX shortcut
          would fail because the filename wasn't properly quoted.  Double
          quotes are now added around a command with spaces before writing out
          the shortcut file.


2008-07-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where duplicate directories could show up in file
          groups.

    * lib/Actions/FileActions/WriteTextToFile.action:
          Fix a bug introduced in the last release.  Files in Write Text to
          File that are relative are made relative to the install dir as the
          docs correctly say.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          In debug mode, make the error messages from actions and conditions
          display more information about the error.


2008-07-16  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where an empty pattern in some file actions would return
          the install directory.

    *** InstallJammer 1.2.7 RELEASED ***


2008-07-07  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/main.tcl:
          Update version for release.


2008-07-04  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action, lib/actions.tcl,
      lib/class.tcl, lib/preview.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where moving an Add Widget action to another pane
          wouldn't actually change its preview parent, so clicking Preview
          Pane on the action would preview its old pane.
          
           Reworked the Add Widget action's properties page to separate
          type-specific properties into an Advanced Properties tab with the
          standard widget properties under a Widget Properties tab.
          
           Added a new File Types property to the Add Widget action for browse
          entry widgets.
          
           Added a new combobox widget type to the Add Widget action.
          
          Changed the text for the Validate Entry On property to Validate On
          since it now applies to more than just entries.  The internal
          property name is still ValidateEntryOn for compatibility.

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action,
      lib/Actions/SystemActions/RemoveDirectoryFromPath.action,
      lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Added a new Separator property to the Add Directory to Path action.
          
           Added a new Separator property to the Remove Directory from Path
          action.

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action:
          Added a new Normalize Paths property to the Add Directory to Path
          action.


2008-07-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallUninstaller.action:
          Fixed a bug where building the uninstaller on some systems would
          build an uninstall that fails in GUI mode.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the uninstall could delete the Install Dir even if
          the installer was not the one who created it.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where Setup Actions could error checking conditions.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where executing an action with an alias could end up
          deleting the alias, which would cause subsequent executions of that
          action by-alias to fail.

    * lib/new.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the new project wizard dialog was not modal.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where configuring some install or uninstall mode that
          did not exist would cause an error in the install.  Each will now
          use the standard mode if the given mode is bogus.

    * lib/new.tcl:
          Release modality on close.


2008-06-25  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/new.tcl:
          Fix a nasty bug where clicking File -> New to create a new project
          does not close any open project and will instead overwrite the open
          project and blow it away.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where building from the command line would expose the
          Install Password in the Install Password pane during installation.

    * lib/trees-filegroup.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the order of UNIX file permissions.  The checkbuttons
          were in the correct order, but the code was not picking up the
          permissions in the correct order.  The read and execute bits were
          flipped.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Set correct default and cancel buttons for standard message dialogs.

    * lib/file.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/new.tcl, lib/virtualtext.tcl:
          Added a new Preserve Windows File Attributes project preference.


2008-06-22  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2.6 RELEASED ***


2008-06-22  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action:

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/unpack.tcl:
          Fix a bug where modified files don't get updated in the unpack
          process, so changes to file objects never get noticed when unpacked.


2008-06-15  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallWindowsShortcut.action,
      lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/uninstall.tcl:
          Minor fixes.


2008-06-13  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Look in the project dir for projects to add to the recent list.

          Fixed a bug in the classic wizard init that would cause it to fail.
          
           Fixed a missing quote in the Dutch translations for the Classic
          Wizard that would cause an error when creating a new project with
          this theme.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Fix a bug where using \ in an image path can cause the image to get
          lost at runtime.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a nasty little bug where the File Update Method was not being
          respected for files being installed.  This would cause things like
          date checks to fail and overwrite modified, existing files.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action, lib/install.tcl,
      lib/unpack.tcl:
          Fix some integer overflows.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Remove debugging.


2008-06-04  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/class.tcl:
          All objects should answer component requests.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Conditions should inherit from TreeObject even if they are
          structured like a tree.  This makes conditions behave more like all
          other objects.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Use the old uninstall if it exists.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Add new Exit API.
          
          Fix bugs in a few API calls.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Added some verbose output from the unpacker.

    * lib/header.tcl:
          Use strict numbers as booleans for the ::debug variable.

    * lib/unpack.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where canceling during installation would sometimes
          cause the process to freeze until killed.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Added more functionality to the debugging command to allow for
          specifying whether you want to debug to the console or file or both.
          
           Fixed a bug where canceling during installation could cause an
          error because the unpack proceeds and tried to update a file that
          wasn't installed.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallWindowsShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug in the new TWAPI shortcut generation where passing a
          blank target for the shortcut would cause an error.  If the target
          is empty, we just point it to C:/.


2008-05-30  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Check the .msg files for encoding hints on the first line just like
          the API.


2008-05-29  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/file.tcl:
          Unset the active components when closing a project so that they
          don't mess with any future projects that are loaded.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed several virtual text variables where there was a bug using the
          Normalize command within their procs.
          
          Fixed instances of using Normalize without fully qualifying the
          command.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action:
          Added a new Validate Entry On property to the Add Widget action. 
          This will allow entry widgets to specify an action that is executed
          when certain events happen.

    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallWindowsShortcut.action:
          Install Windows Shortcut will now use TWAPI as its method of
          creating the shortcut when it is available.  This will fix the
          problems many people are having installing shortcuts on Asian
          character sets in Windows.

    * Binaries/Windows/craplzma0.1/craplzma01.dll:
          Committed the correct version of the LZMA library on Windows.  This
          will fix issues with building installers using LZMA compression on
          Windows.

    * Binaries/Windows/installkit.com, Binaries/Windows/installkit.exe,
      installjammer.com, installjammer.exe:

    * lib/trees.tcl:
          Remove some code that was probably intended to work when you

          drag-and-drop behavior now seems to be correct.

    * lib/trees-filegroup.tcl:
          Refresh file groups to find all new files before filtering any.

          Added new SetFileTypeEOL API to specify the end-of-line character to
          use for specific file types during installation.  This will

          Set the minimum size for the choose directory dialog but don't
          explicitly specify the geometry.  This will allow it to expand for
          longer text strings but still maintain a minimum size.

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/Common/CustomBlankPane1.tcl:
          Change the default background of the large image in Custom Blank

      lib/Conditions/FileConditions/FileNameTestCondition.condition,

          validity.
          
          Added a check to the Select Program Folder pane to check for a valid
          folder name before allowing the user to proceed.

    * lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl:
          Modernized the choose directory dialog.  The label showing the

2008-04-13  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Revert change where we included all languages.  The AddLanguage +
          LoadMessageCatalog APIs will take care of special cases.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fix that allows the system language to always be the first one we
          check, followed by default language and finally English.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          We don't need to explicitly add English anymore.  It will be set as
          the last resort in the locale on all installers.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl:
          More fixes for getting the right preference order for locales.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/editor.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Added a new "All" language to text fields that will set all
          languages with the same message when used.  When retrieving text for
          the All language, text will only be retrieved if all languages have
          the same text.  Otherwise, the text is blank.

          aren't that big, and it helps to support the auto-detection.

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/dobuild.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/main.tcl:
          Some fixes for OS X.


2008-04-09  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Try to fix the stupid window title bug on Solaris again.

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/ru.msg, lib/msgs/installer/ru.msg,
      lib/msgs/languages.txt, lib/packages/InstallJammer/lang/ru.rc:
          Adding Russian translations (thanks to Stanislav Borutsky

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/ar.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/de.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/es.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/fr.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/hu.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/it.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/nl.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/pl.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/pt_br.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/ru.msg:
          Removed the dummy test for Readma panes so that they don't display
          the wrong information in a language other than English.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          The order of Before Pane is Displayed actions and conditions has
          been reversed.  Previously, the actions would execute first, but
          this is the opposite of the way every other check works.  The
          conditions will now be checked before the pane is displayed, and if
          they fail, the wizard will move forward without ever executing the
          actions.
           Fixed a bug where the various move wizard actions would always move
          on step extra because the wizard was not noticing that the actions
          had moved forward.

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/hu.msg:
          Fix typo in the Hungarian messages (thanks to tyuk!)

    * lib/build.tcl, lib/dobuild.tcl:
          Added some code to handle errors in the Windows build thread and
          output them properly to the log.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/main.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where not all languages would appear as choices in the
          builder.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a new AddLanguage API call.

    * lib/conditions.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where opening the condition editor could cause
          copy-and-paste actions to not work anymore.

    * Themes/Classic_Wizard/hu.msg:
          Fixed typos in Hungarian translations.

    * lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl, lib/common.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl,
      lib/msgs/installer/en.msg:
          Added new PromptForDirectoryNewFolderText virtual text to the
          English message catalog.  This is the default text for the Make New
          Folder button on the Choose Directory dialog.  Translations will be
          added as they become available.


2008-04-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug with the new auto-locale code.  We force English in the
          builder for now.
          Hopefully fixed a bug with the message box titles on some platforms.
           Fixed a typo in the <%FileGroup%> virtual text that caused an
          error.


2008-04-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/main.tcl:
          Add a blank default Editor preference.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fix a bug in the message box code.


2008-04-02  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Dummying up some methods for compliance.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added a new -object option the SetVirtualText API.  This allows for
          setting virtual text on objects like panes and actions.
           Added new LoadMessageCatalog API.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Oops.  Left some debug code in.

    * lib/main.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Some quick fixes for the runtime image support.

    * lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action:
          Fixed a bug in Execute External Program where using progressive
          output would not accurately set the exit status on error.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Check for the existence of the wizard before setting the title.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Only modify Command key bindings on OS X.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Don't check to see if the file is writable before we've checked to
          see if it exists.


2008-04-01  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Added a parent method that was missing and a dummy name method for
          conditions to make them compliant with other tree objects.

    * lib/install.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the SetActiveSetupType API where it was not
          repopulating the components correctly.
           Added a new, powerful FindObjects API for locating just about
          anything in the system.


2008-03-31  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl, lib/install.tcl, lib/installapi.tcl:
          The system default language will now be used as the default language
          in the installer if it is supported.  If the installer does not
          include the language for the user's system, the Default Language
          will be used in its place.


2008-03-30  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/BWidget/tablelist.tcl, lib/common.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl,
      lib/utils.tcl, lib/virtualtext.tcl:
          Added a new Editor external program preference to specify an editor
          to use when editing multi-line text.  InstallJammer will create a
          temporary file, execute the selected editor and watch for changes on
          the file and propagate them back into the project.

    * lib/file.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Re-enabled the Save as button for projects.  With the new Duplicate
          Project option, this shouldn't be nearly as confusing as before.
           Added a check when saving to see if the project file is writable. 
          If it's not, InstallJammer can attempt to make the file writable
          before saving at the user's request.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Brain fart.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Output the new width and height variables in the installer.

    * lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action:
          Added a new Watch Virtual Text property to allow matching of
          patterns without an actual virtual text variable in the pattern. 
          Regular expressions with less than two sub match patterns will use
          this variable as the default.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallWrappedScript.action:
          Added new Include TWAPI property to the Install Wrapped Script
          action.  This allows wrapped scripts on the target system to include
          the TWAPI extension on Windows platforms.  The script will be
          automatically modified with a small header to load the TWAPI
          extension automatically.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Added the ability to specify images in an installer at runtime. 
          Image properties can now contain a file on the build system, a file
          on the target system or an ID or Alias to a file stored within the
          installer.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Slight change to external editor behavior.  Allow for a %filename%
          to be specified on the command-line instead of always appending the
          file to the command string.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Added a new Command Line Actions group that replaces the Setup
          Actions group in terms of location.  The Command Line Actions group
          executes before the command-line options have been parsed, and the
          Setup Actions group now executes after the command-line options have
          been parsed.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where checking conditions before the GuiMode variable
          had been initialized would cause an error.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/UnpackStoredFile.action, lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the Unpack Stored File action would create the
          original install directory for the packed file by mistake.

    * lib/class.tcl, lib/common.tcl, lib/header.tcl:
          Added a new Test Component property to Panes, Actions and
          Conditions.  This property tells the (un)installer whether the given
          component should be executed when the installer is run in test mode.
           This allows to disabling things like license panels and other
          annoying things when a developer is testing.

    * lib/class.tcl, lib/common.tcl, lib/file.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl,
      lib/main.tcl, lib/trees-filegroup.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Changed Test Component feature to Include with more options than
          just Yes or No.
          Rewrote some of the internals when dealing with properties that have
          lists of options.  These are now stored as integers instead of
          entire strings and then mapped in the code.  This should save some
          storage space in the installers.

    * lib/cmdline.tcl, lib/main.tcl:
          Added new --test-without-installing command-line build option to
          pass the --test option to the installer when testing.
           Made it legal to pass a directory on the command-line, and the
          builder will figure out which project file in the directory to use
          if it can.


2008-03-29  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteScript.action,
      lib/Conditions/GeneralConditions/ExecuteScriptCondition.condition:
          Fixed a bug in the Execute Script action where returning a value
          would result in an error.

    * lib/common.tcl, lib/convert.tcl, lib/file.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          When a project is converted to a new version, it is now
          automatically saved, and a backup is made of the previous project
          file.

    * lib/file.tcl, lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug that would not allow multiple directories with the same
          name to exist in a file group.

    * Themes/Classic_Wizard/Install/init.tcl,
      Themes/Classic_Wizard/Uninstall/init.tcl,
      Themes/Classic_Wizard/theme.cfg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/init.tcl,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/Uninstall/init.tcl, Themes/Modern_Wizard/theme.cfg,
      lib/file.tcl, lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/themes.tcl:
          Added new Wizard Height and Wizard Width properties to the Install
          Features section.  These allow the developer to alter the size of
          the wizard during (un)installation.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/new.tcl, lib/trees-filegroup.tcl:
          Added a new Default Directory Location to the Project Preferences. 
          This property, if set, specifies the Location to use for all files
          and directories that are direct descendants of a file group if their
          own Location is not set.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Made builds more robust when we hit unexpected errors.  The errors
          should now go correctly to the build log, and the builder should go
          back to a known state so that the build can be tried again.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where multiple channels were opened to the debug log.


2008-03-28  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallUNIXShortcut.action:
          Fixed a bug in shortcut actions where setting Command Line
          Properties did not propagate on UNIX platforms.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          The SetVirtualText API now recognizes update actions and commands on
          language-specific virtual text.  This allows tracking changes to
          language text.
           The SetVirtualText API's -language option now accepts the language
          code or full language name (en or English, etc...).

    * lib/common.tcl:
          The title of the installer and wizard are now specified in the
          InstallTitleText virtual text.  Both will update automatically
          anytime this virtual text changes.


2008-03-24  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/BWidget/lang/hu.rc:
          Add Hungarian language file for BWidgets.

    * installjammer.com, installjammer.exe, lib/build.tcl, lib/cmdline.tcl,
      lib/common.tcl, lib/dobuild.tcl:
          Windows command-line builds are now done synchronously through a new
          installjamemr.com binary.  This will better allow scripting builds
          on the Windows platform.


2008-03-23  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where passing --temp on the command line would not
          actually set the Temp virtual text.
           Fixed a bug where attempting to paste an object with conditions
          would cause an error.
           Fixed several bugs with message boxes on non-Windows platforms.
           Fixed a bug and an inconsistency with the SpaceAvailable virtual
          text on non-Windows platforms.
           Fixed a bug where deleting objects from the system would not remove
          all of their virtual text from the project file.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Call PostCommonInit later in the startup process to allow the Temp
          virtual text to be set correctly before being used.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where opening a project from the right-click menu in the
          project list would result in an error.


2008-03-22  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/build.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the command-line builds that will allow better
          command-line behavior on Windows.


2008-03-18  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the build process for uninstalls that was due to the
          Setup Actions changes.


2008-03-14  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in ::InstallAPI::FindProcesses on Windows.
           Added a -glob argument to ::InstallAPI::FindProcesses (Windows-only
          currently).


2008-03-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where using tk_getOpenFile would error on non-Windows
          platforms.
           Installers will now focus on the Next button by default when moving
          panes.
           Fixed several bugs relating to "match any" conditions.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Minor changes to paths on different platforms.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl, lib/gui-osx.tcl, lib/gui-windows.tcl:
          When editing a property, clicking away from the property will now
          auto-save the property.  You no longer have to hit Return to save
          the change.  This may cause some problems with errors in properties.
          
          Cleaned up some of the platform GUI code.

    * lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where opening a choose directory dialog from a Windows
          network share would error out.
           Removed the entry box on the choose directory dialog.  Make New
          Folder is sufficient for specifying a folder name, and the entry was
          just confusing.

    * lib/BWidget/properties.tcl:
          Adding bindings for start, cancel and finish editing events.

    * lib/Actions/ConsoleActions/ConsoleGetUserInput.action:
          Added new Require Response property to the Console Get User Input
          action.  This says that the user cannot provide an empty response
          and must give something.

    * lib/Actions/SystemActions/RegisterPackage.action:
          Added a Package Databases property to the Register Package action. 
          This allows the developer to specify that they only want to support
          RPM, DPKG or all package managers.  All is the default for backward
          compatibility.


2008-03-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed several bugs between setting Aliases of objects and their
          title in the component tree.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          We no longer source common.tcl since it's part of the startup.


2008-03-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/build.tcl, lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug that caused the Setup Actions group to never actually
          execute.


2008-03-09  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in ::InstallAPI::PromptForFile on Windows.


2008-03-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/build.tcl:
          Fix a small bug for command-line builds.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fix a bug in installers with non-ASCII characters.


2008-02-22  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where condition failure messages would pop up in the
          wrong place on some systems.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where symlink'd files on UNIX were being truncated once
          installed on Windows.
           Fixed a bug where a symlink'd directory would end up creating a
          recursive symlink on the target system during installation.


2008-02-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/preview.tcl:
          Fix a bug in preview.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/MoveToPane.action:
          Subst for aliases in the Pane property.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/ModifyWidget.action:
          Fixed a bug in the Modify Widget action where the parent could not
          be determined if the action was attached to a checkbutton or
          something else.


2008-02-05  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2.5 RELEASED ***


2008-02-05  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/class.tcl:
          Added new Size property to Components.
          
           Added new Size property to File Groups.
          
           Added new Display Name property to Components.
          
           Added new Display Name property to Setup Types.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Added some new code to help get language-specific virtual text.

    * lib/convert.tcl:
          Unset the Size property of File Groups that was previously stored in
          the project file.  It was never seen by the user, and now the user
          can set it.

    * lib/file.tcl:
          Open and Save project files with a utf-8 encoding so that non-ASCII
          text is automatically translated and made correct with each load and
          save.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Fixed a small GUI bug that was incorrectly populating text fields
          for Components.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Changes to facilitate the new Size properties for Components and
          File Groups.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Changes to facilitate the new Size properties for Components and
          File Groups.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Bumped the version.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where copying and pasting and object would miss the text
          properties.

    * lib/Actions/FileActions/ReadFileIntoVirtualText.action:
          Added a new Encoding property to the Read File Into Virtual Text
          action.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Took a first whack at making sure the same file listed multiple
          times within the same file group are not counted or installed twice.
           The next step is to make sure that the same file doesn't get
          installed twice no matter what group it's in.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateComponents.action,
      lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateSetupTypes.action:
          Check for a Display Name when populating components and setup types.
           If it's empty, use the standard name.

    * lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/RegisterWindowsLibrary.action,
      lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/UnregisterWindowsLibrary.action:
          Added new Register Windows Library action.
          
           Added new Unregister Windows Library action.

    * lib/Conditions/WindowsConditions/WindowsServiceTestCondition.condition:
          Fixed a bug in the Windows Service Test condition where the
          condition would error-out if the service did not exist.

    * lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl:
          Fixed some minor bugs in the Choose Directory dialog.
           Added a check for illegal characters in a directory name.

    * lib/BWidget/tree.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in keyboard navigation in the choose directory dialog.

    * lib/Actions/FileActions/ReadFileIntoVirtualText.action:
          Read File Into Virtual Text now reads files as text instead of
          binary by default.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Some minor cleanup.

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/RemoveFromUninstall.action:
          Added new Remove From Uninstall action.

    * lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions,
      lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/ContinueWindowsService.action,
      lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/CreateWindowsService.action,
      lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/DeleteWindowsService.action,
      lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/PauseWindowsService.action,
      lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/StartWindowsService.action,
      lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/StopWindowsService.action:
          Added new actions to deal with Windows services.

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Added checks for the new Remove from Uninstall action.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/ModifyWidget.action:
          Fixed a bug in Modify Widget where modifying existing text
          properties was not modifying the text properly.

    * lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateComponents.action:
          Fixed a bug where populating components with radiobuttons where no
          button was checked would make them all checked.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Installs are now built entirely to a temporary file and only renamed
          to their final location once the build has completely successfully. 
          This means that broken builds will not overwrite good installers
          that area already there.
           If a build fails with errors, it is now reported as having failed
          instead of completed.
           The files being packed are now shown as full paths instead of
          filenames.  This makes it easier to identify files within a build at
          the expense of some clutter.
           Building solid archives now shows packing log messages.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Reading project files no longer assumes a UTF-8 encoding.
           Added a new debugging command to turn debugging on and off more
          easily from the console as well as log debug information to a file.
           Fixed a bug where the WINDOWS virtual text was being reported
          incorrectly on some systems.  Despite my better judgment, we'll
          trust the environment variables.
           Browsing for a directory will now initialize to the current
          directory if it exists.
           Symbolic links are now created using the system 'ln -s'.  The
          built-in Tcl 'file link' command seems to be poorly thought out.
           Checking conditions can now have a boolean AND or OR instead of
          just always being AND.

    * lib/conditions.tcl:
          Added the ability to specify that conditions should be matched with
          an AND (Match all of the following) or an OR (Match any of the
          following).

    * lib/dobuild.tcl:
          Echo the full file path on progress.  Let the program decide what to
          do with it once it has it.

    * lib/gui-common.tcl:
          Added a Build Failure project preference to tell InstallJammer how
          to handle missing files when building from the GUI.

    * lib/install.tcl:
          Added checks for the new Remove From Uninstall action.

    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Added new ExecuteAction API call.

    * lib/new.tcl:
          Set the default Build Failure property for new projects.

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/ar.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/de.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/es.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/fr.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/pl.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/pt_br.msg:
          Removed dummy license text from all but English translations so that
          a single license will display correctly in all languages.

    * Themes/Modern_Wizard/pt_br.msg:
          Minor correction from translator.

    * Themes/Classic_Wizard/hu.msg, Themes/Classic_Wizard/it.msg,
      Themes/Classic_Wizard/nl.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/hu.msg,
      Themes/Modern_Wizard/it.msg, Themes/Modern_Wizard/nl.msg,
      lib/msgs/installer/hu.msg, lib/msgs/installer/it.msg,
      lib/msgs/installer/nl.msg, lib/msgs/languages.txt:
          Added Dutch translations (thanks to Jethro Borsje!).
           Added Italian translations (thanks to LukenShiro!).
           Added Hungarian translations (thanks to Nagy Istvan!).

    * lib/Conditions/WindowsConditions/WindowsServiceTestCondition.condition:
          Added new Windows Service Test condition.

    * lib/Actions/WindowsServiceActions/CreateWindowsService.action:
          Add Database and System properties to Create Windows Service action.

    * docs/InstallJammer User Guide.pdf, docs/InstallJammer.chm,
      docs/html/122.html, docs/html/123.html, docs/html/AddPaneToOrder.html,
      docs/html/ContinueWindowsService.html,

          Updated documentation.

    * lib/main.tcl:
          Bumped the version.


2007-12-30  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/BWidget/wizard.tcl:
          Added -minwidth and -minheight options to wizard.

    * lib/build.tcl:
          Added some new conf variables.

    * lib/header.tcl:
          Added some new conf variables.

    * lib/new.tcl:
          Fixed a bug where the buttons on the new project wizard would
          sometimes not appear correctly.


2007-10-26  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2.3 RELEASED ***


2007-10-26  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsRegistryKey.action:
          Fixed a typo Add Windows Registry action.

    * lib/common.tcl:
          Fixed a bug in the Alias handling code that caused new projects to
          fail with an error saying Install Actions could not be found.

    * lib/utils.tcl:
          Fixed a bug that causes multiple projects loaded in the same session
          to build and output into the wrong directories.


2007-10-25  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2.2 RELEASED ***


2007-10-25  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    * lib/installapi.tcl:
          Fixed a typo in ::InstallAPI::EncodeURL that would cause Launch Web
          Browser actions to fail. [Bug #1819487]

    * lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action:
          Fixed a typo in Uninstall Selected Files that would cause a failure
          when restoring a registry value on Windows. [Bug #1819503]

    * lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action, lib/common.tcl,
      lib/dobuild.tcl, lib/install.tcl:
          Fixed a bug on UNIX platforms where creating a directory that isn't
          writable would cause the rest of the install to fail when it tried
          to write into that directory.  Directory permissions are now set
          after all files have been installed.


2007-10-23  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2.1 RELEASED ***


2007-10-23  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/Binaries/FreeBSD-x86
    Update FreeBSD binaries.  They were missed in the last release.

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/LaunchWebBrowser.action
    Fixed missing argument to EncodeURL.

* lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFile.action
    Fixed a bug where forcefully removing a directory didn't actually work.

    Added some debug output.

* lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsRegistryKey.action
    Fixed a typo that caused this action to disappear from the last release.

* lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action
    Added Label Justify property to specify how labels should be justified
    on the screen.

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where setting an alias might not always work.

* lib/convert.tcl
    Fixed a bug where a project that was converted during a command-line
    build would fail with an error.

* lib/file.tcl
    Changed some of the dialog messages.

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Added New Project Wizard item to the File menu.  The New item now just
    creates a project with all defaults.

    Disabled the Save as option.  This only causes confusion.  Use
    Duplicate Project instead.

* lib/gui-osx.tcl
    OS X gui cleanup.

* lib/main.tcl
    Upped the version to 1.2.1.

* lib/new.tcl
    Added commands to build a new, default project.

* lib/trees-filegroup.tcl
    Fixed a bug where the Target Filename property was not working.

* lib/uninstall.tcl
    Added some debugging messages to the registry cleanup process.

* lib/utils.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause an error in command-line builds if a new
    file was found.

    Added new Duplicate Project option.

    Added new Rename Project option.

    Made deleting a project a lot safer.  Now we only attempt to delete
    files and directories that might actually be ours.

    Made the message in the delete dialog a lot clearer about what is about
    to happen.

2007-10-21  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2 RELEASED ***


2007-10-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/common.tcl
    Added <%COMMON_QUICK_LAUNCH%> virtual directory on Windows.

* lib/build.tcl
    Fixed a bug where using a single non-English language would cause
    some text to appear blank.  This is because the default behavior
    is to fall back to English when no other text is available, but
    the English language wasn't being included in the build because
    it wasn't a chosen language.  From now on, English will always
    be included as the fallback.

* lib/Actions/JavaActions/LocateJavaRuntime.action
    Search for JDKs on Windows.  Previously, only JRE directories
    and registry entries were being searched.

* lib/Actions/FileActions/AdjustLineFeeds.action
* lib/Actions/FileActions/ReplaceTextInFile.action
    Fixed a bug where the linefeeds of the file were being mangled.

2007-10-18  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/main.tcl
    *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

    Rewrote the command-line parsing routines again to be more specific
    about what is matched as options and switches.  This may still cause
    some incompatibilities, but it should cause less since it's specifically
    looking for known options and switches.

    Added new --build-dir and --output-dir command-line options for building.

    Added new --verbose option to specify verbose build output.

    Updated the usage output to reflect all available options.


2007-10-07  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* Binaries/*/*
    Recompiled installkit binaries for all platforms.

    The format of the virtual filesystem in the installkits was changed
    to allow for faster reading of larger installs and on hard media
    like CDs and DVDs.  The headers of the files in the filesystem are
    now all stored at the end of the file instead of scattered
    throughout.

    Added support for creating zip files.

* installjammer.tcl
    Normalize the startup path.

* lib/Actions/ConsoleActions/ConsoleGetUserInput
    Added new Echo Input property to allow for prompting for passwords
    and the like.

* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram
    Added Watch Regular Expression property to specify the regexp that
    IJ will look for when watching progressive output for special strings.

    Fixed some places where an error would not be returned.

    Remove \r from Windows output before checking for watch strings.

    Fixed a bug where Include Stderr would leave a $1 turd file behind.

* lib/Actions/FileActions/CopyFile.action
    Allow Source to be specified as patterns that are all copied to the
    Destination.

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/LaunchWebBrowser.action
    Encode any special characters in the URL before launching the browser.

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/ModifyObject.action
    Use "set Active" instead of just "active" so that properties in both
    places are set by the action.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action
    Added some verbose debugging output.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallUninstaller.action
    Use a unique name for mounting installers instead of always using the
    same name, which could cause conflicts.

* lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallProgramFolderShortcut.action
    Fixed a bug where the folder name would be ignored on Windows.

* lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action
    Make sure we only add directories once, and make sure we're not
    adding one that already exists.

* lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddEnvironmentVariable.action
    Fixed a bug in Restore on Uninstall.

* lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action
    Fixed a bug removing paths on Windows.

* lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsRegistryKey.action
    Added new Restore on Uninstall property.

* lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/RemoveWindowsRegistryKey.action
    Fixed a bug where specifying a Value would never remove the value.

* lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action
    Added new Off Value and On Value properties for checkbuttons.
    If the defaults values are left in place, the value of the virtual
    text will automatically be translated into a boolean 0 or 1 to match
    the checkbuttons.

* lib/Conditions/SystemConditions/EnvVariableTestCondition.condition
    Substitute the Variable for virtual text before checking the environment.

* lib/actions.tcl
    Fixed a bug where newly-created action groups could not be used as a
    drag-and-drop target.

* lib/build.tcl
    Moved some code around to support the new Auto Refresh File Groups
    option.

    Fixed a bug where command-line failures were not being stopped.

    If a command-line build fails for missing files, it will not fail
    further up in the process and not delete any existing install that
    may have previously been there.

    Added code to support building zip files.

    Added progress to .tar and .zip platform builds.

* lib/common.tcl
    Subst the pattern string before we split on ; to find files for a
    given list of patterns.

    Fixed a bug where sym links were not being recognized and installed
    as such.

* lib/file.tcl
    Added support for refreshing file groups on-demand.

    Fixed a bug in recognizing symlinks.

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Remember the pane settings for the main window.

    Added new project preference, Refresh File List Before Building, which
    is enabled by default.  This is the current behavior, but this can now
    be turned off, and the user can refresh on-demand.

    Added the Zip Archive platform.

* lib/header.tcl
    *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

    Virtual text variables are no longer auto adjusted for boolean values.
    This was originally done to make checkbuttons easier, but it caused so
    many problems that it seems silly to make a case for something small
    like checkbuttons when the rest of the world suffers.

    Checkbuttons are now handled separately, and virtual text variables
    are not manipulated by InstallJammer when being read or written.

* lib/installapi.tcl
    Added ::InstallAPI::EncodeURL API call.

* lib/main.tcl
    *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

    Rewrote the code that parses command-line arguments passed to
    InstallJammer.  This should only affect someone who is passing
    a VALUE of an argument that starts with --.  Otherwise, arguments
    should be parsed exactly as they were.

    The new method of parsing assumes that arguments are not necessarily
    delineated by a space.  Instead, the value of an option ends when
    either another option is found or we see -- which signifies the end
    of options.

* lib/trees-filegroup.tcl
    Show comments correctly on files and directories.

* lib/virtualtext.tcl
    Fixed a bug where editing virtual text would sometimes fail with a
    missing variable error.


2007-07-23  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where browse button for Windows Icon was not a toolbar button.

* lib/install.tcl
    Fixed a bug where SetInstallDir was being called with an argument.

* lib/main.tcl
    Updated version to 1.2.

* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action
    Fixed a bug that caused progressive output for console installs to fail.


2007-07-23  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.2b2 RELEASED ***

2007-07-21  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/build.tcl
    Added new Fallback to Console platform property that allows an installer
    or uninstaller to fall back to a console install if the GUI initialization
    fails.

    Search for available packages in the project directory and in the
    lib/packages directory and include any found in the installer.

* lib/builderapi.tcl
    Added new ::BuilderAPI::ModifyObject command.

    Added new ::BuilderAPI::SetPlatformProperty command.

* lib/class.tcl
    Added new FallbackToConsole platform property for UNIX platforms that
    defaults to Yes.

* lib/common.tcl
    Check and set a variable if we're on Vista.

    Added new ScriptExt virtual text.

    Added new InstallRegistryInfo virtual text.

    When installing on Vista, always install program folder icons for all users.

    Added new InstallDirSuffix virtual text.

    Added new InstallDrive virtual text on Windows.

    If the Cancel button is disabled on a pane, the X button is also now
    disabled.

    Added new UpdateSelectedWidgets proc that will only update selected
    widgets.

    Fixed a bug that was severely slowing down the performance of requesting
    recursive children of an object.

    Added new FindUpdateWidgets proc that will take a list of virtual text
    and find all the widgets on the current pane that would actually use them.

    When an uninstall fails to remove a file for any reason, the uninstall
    will not delete itself on exit and instead populate itself with the
    information it needs to complete the uninstall on a subsequent run.

    Fixed a bug where Abort/Retry/Ignore message boxes would also end up with
    a No button.

    Record information about the command-line options passed in for use later.

    Fixed a bug where calling an installer with .. in the path would cause
    the installer to fail with the help usage.

    When exiting the installer, we will broadcast an event to Windows to
    update the registry environment if it has been changed during
    installation.

    Fixed a bug where a line of just the right width could go over when
    wrapping text in console mode.

    Subst the value the Target Filename if one exists for a value.

    Fixed a bug where conditions failing in console mode would cause an error.

* lib/conditions.tcl
    Action groups now have the same Check Condition values as actions.

* lib/convert.tcl
    Fixed a minor bug in the conversion of projects from 1.1b1 to 1.1.

* lib/edit.tcl
    Fixed a bug where pasting text would paste the same text twice.

* lib/editor.tcl
    Added the ability to specify a font when creating an edit window.

* lib/file.tcl
    Fixed a bug where cancelling the save when exiting the program could
    cause the builder to get into an unknown state where the title of the
    window would not be updated.

    Fixed a bug where aliases on files were not being written out to the
    installer, so files could not be referenced by their alias.

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Added a new Fall Back to Console platform property for non-Windows
    platforms that tells InstallJammer to fall back to a console when
    the GUI initialization fails.

* lib/header.tcl
    Added the ability to add actions and commands to the udpate of virtual
    text so that a particular action or command could be called anytime a
    virtual text variable is updated.

* lib/install.tcl
    Fixed a bug in the calculation of required install size.

    Added a new InstallRegistryInfo variable that, if false, means that
    InstallJammer will not install information to a separate registry
    directory.  Instead, the uninstall information will be stored directly
    into the uninstaller itself.

    Fixed a bug where install messages were being wrongly output during a
    silent install.

    Greatly improved the performance of file installation on larger and
    longer-running installers.

    Fixed a bug where passing --prefix on the command-line while root
    would be ignored.

* lib/installapi.tcl
    Added new ::InstallAPI::ErrorMessage command to display errors.

    Fixed a bug where multiple calls to FetchURL with proxy arguments
    would continue to use the same proxy once set.

    Updated ::InstallAPI::FindProcesses to work on Windows using the TWAPI
    extension to find processes.

    Added new ::InstallAPI::SetObjectProperty command to set any property
    on an object.

    Added -action and -command arguments to ::InstallAPI::SetVirtualText to
    specify an action or command to execute whenever the specified virtual
    text is modified.

    Added new ::InstallAPI::URLIsValid command to validate a given URL.

* lib/main.tcl
    Fixed a bug where certain project files passed into the builder would
    not work.  The project file passed is now normalized before continuing on.

    Updated version to 1.2b2.

* lib/preview.tcl
    Fixed a bug that made previewing panes impossible on UNIX.

* lib/trees.tcl
    Allowed the re-ordering of acion groups in the bulider.

    Fixed a bug where re-ordering components wouldn't actually update
    their order during installation.

* lib/tress-filegroup.tcl
    Fixed a bug where source file locations were not always being substituted
    properly.

* lib/uninstall.tcl
    Uninstallers will now look for their uninstall information files from
    within themselves first before checking for a registry directory.

* lib/unpack.tcl
    Increased the speed of file installation by letting the unpack routines
    evaluate messages before passing them back to the installer and not
    passing any messages we don't have to.

* lib/utils.tcl
    The pane code editor is now a Courier 10 font.

    Changing the Alias of a pane, action or action group will not
    automatically update its title in the builder for easier recognition.

    When searching for Windows icons, the builder will now check the project
    directory first before looking in its own directory structure.

* lib/virtualtext.tcl
    Made ScriptExt a reserved virtual text.

* lib/Actions/ConsoleActions/ConsoleGetUserInput.action
    Fixed a bug where the resulting user input would not be saved in the
    virtual text if the virtual text didn't exist to begin with.

* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteAction.action
    Fixed a bug where if the action being executed was an action group,
    the action groups conditions would not be checked.

    Action groups now check conditions before to see if the action group
    should be executed and then after to see if the install should move
    forward or execute the whole action group again.

* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action
    Added new Include Stderr property to include the standard error channel
    on recorded output.

    When showing progressive output, we blank the text widget at the start
    of our action and then we tell InstallJammer not to automatically update
    this widget anymore, which means that the output from the program will
    not be erased as soon as the action is over.

    Fixed a bug where progressive output actions would never show that they
    had completed and thereby leave the installer in a frozen state.

    Changed the mapping for Windows output so that the text looks right in
    a progressive output widget.

    Show progressive output even in console mode.

* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteScript.action
    Changed the text editor for the Tcl Script property to a fixed font.

* lib/Actions/FileActions/UnzipFile.action
    Added Progressive Virtual Text property to specify a virtual text
    variable to update with the percentage complete as the files are unzipped.

    Added Status Virtual Text property to specify a virtual text variable
    to update with a progressive status as the files are unzipped.

    Fixed a bug where multiple calls to this action would actually stack up
    the files and continue to unpack previous files into other locations.

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/SetObjectProperty.action
    Added new Set Object Property action to set properties on objects.

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/TextWindow.action
    Make sure that the Text Window action only executes in GUI mode.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action
    Made rollback on cancelled installs a lot cleaner and faster.

    Moved the update Windows registry call to the end of the install.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallUninstaller.action
    The uninstaller no longer adds itself to the list of files to be
    uninstalled.  It will automatically remove itself when appropriate
    during uninstallation.

* lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action
    Added new Add to Uninstall property to specify that the new path
    added should be removed automatically during uninstallation.

    Updated this action to work on UNIX platforms.

* lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddEnvironmentVariable.action
    New action to add environment variables.  This works for all platforms.

* lib/Actions/SystemActions/DeleteEnvironmentVariable.action
    New action to delete environment variables.  This works only on Windows.

* lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action
    If we fail to remove all of the files for any reason, the uninstall
    will remain on the system for later removal.

    Added routines to remove environment variables that are added during
    installation.

    Added routines to remove paths from directory environment variables
    that are added during installation.

* lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsRegistryKey.action
    Fixed a bug where registry keys that were added to the uninstall were
    not being removed properly.

* lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action
    Added new Action property to specify an action to be executed whenever
    the user clicks a button or modifies a radiobutton or checkbutton.

    Added new "button" type to create buttons on a pane.

* lib/Actions/WizardActions/PopulateComponents.action
    Fixed a bug that would cause component population on a screen to act
    very weird when moving back and forth through an installation.  Components
    that were inactive used to be excluded from the shown list, but since
    IJ marks components as inactive when they are unchecked, this would cause
    them to disappear on subsequent runs.

    Now, the only way to get a component to not show up is by setting its
    ShowComponent property to false.  This can be done with the new API
    call or by the new Set Object Property action.

* lib/Conditions/FileConditions/FilePermissionCondition.condition
    Fixed a bug where installing to a root drive on Windows could cause
    an infinite loop to occur when validating that directory.

* lib/Conditions/GeneralConditions/ObjectTestCondition.condition
    Added new operators: "does not exist" and "exists" to the Object Test
    Condition.

* lib/Conditions/GeneralConditions/VirtualTextTestCondition.condition
    Added new "was set from the command line" operator to the Virtual Text
    Test condition that will test whether the given virtual text was set
    by any option from the command line.

* lib/Conditions/GeneralConditions/CommandLineTest.condition
    Added new Command Line Test condition to test the options passed on the
    command line.

    *** InstallJammer 1.2b1 RELEASED ***


2007-05-17  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/actions.tcl
    Fixed a bug where selecting multiple panes and then adding a new
    action would cause an error.  Actions are now added to the last
    pane selected.

* lib/build.tcl
    When building now, the file code is stored in a separate file in
    the build directory so that subsequent quick builds can re-use
    the same files without rebuilding the list.  This makes quick
    builds MUCH faster, especially on larger projects.

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug when substituting strings for evaluation.

* lib/conditions.tcl
    Added new code to support copy-and-paste of conditions in the
    conditions editor.

    Fixed a minor bug in the editor when cancelling an edit.

    The text editor now remembers its size and position between sessions.

* lib/file.tcl
    Fixed an error when checking file permissions on Windows.

    and with what arguments.

    Fixed in a bug in PromptForFile where an error would occur if the
    user hit the cancel button.

* lib/main.tcl
    Updated version to 1.2b1.

* lib/trees.tcl
    New code to support copy-and-paste.

* lib/trees-filegroup.tcl
    New code to mark when files are modified in a project.

* lib/utils.tcl
    New code to support other changes.


2007-05-04  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* Binaries/*
    Updated binaries to a new installkit.  FreeBSD is not done yet.

* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action
    Added debug output.

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/LaunchFile.action
    Added debug output.

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/ModifyObject.action

2007-04-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/utils.tcl
    Fixed a bug where adding multiple files to a file group would
    cause an error. [Bug #1702000]


2007-04-19  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Added a section for specifying which languages should be included
    in an installer.

    Added an option to preserve file permissions on UNIX.

    Reordered the check buttons for UNIX permissions to reflect the
    standard order.

* lib/build.tcl
    Changed the way action and conditions are stored in an installer.

    Made a better effort to cleanup a cancelled install so as not to
    leave the program in an unknown state.

    Store only languages that are being used in the installer.

    Automatically include the TWAPI extension if we find the user has
    used it somewhere in their code.


2007-04-15  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action
    Added debugging messages to show more of what is happening when
    executing an external program.

* lib/Actions/FileActions/ChangeFilePermissions.action
    Fixed a bug where permissions were not set properly based on the mask.

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/LaunchFile.action
    Changed the way arguments are passed to the command line.  This should
    fix a bug where backslashes are being substituted out as they are passed.

* lib/Actions/JavaActions/LocateJavaRuntime.action
    Added a property to find a full JDK instead of just a JRE.  This also
    sets the new <%JavacExecutable%> virtual text if the JDK is found.

* lib/Actions/ShortcutActions/InstallWindowsShortcut.action
    Removed the requirement that the file exist before creating the shortcut.
    This allows the ability to create a shortcut to a program that launches
    another program. [Req #1682449]

* lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsFileCommand.action
* lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsFileExtension.action
* lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsFileType.action
* lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsRegistryKey.action

    Added a label frame widget to create group boxes.

    Added a text widget to create text box widgets.

* lib/Actions/WizardActions/ModifyWidget.action
    Added a new 'readonly' state that can be applied to entry and text
    widgets.

* lib/build.tcl
    Fixed a bug where an uninstaller would not remember the information
    from the installer. [Bug #1676588]

    Automatically include the TWAPI extension if we find that the developer
    has used twapi somewhere in the installer.

* lib/class.tcl
    Made actions and conditions store the same way so that each can include
    the other.  This lets a condition require an action and vice-versa.

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where a destroyed window can still be in the parent window
    list and cause an error. [Bug #1672859]

* lib/Conditions/UserInputConditions/AskYesOrNo.condition
    Ask Yes or No condition now includes the Console Ask Yes or No action
    and will use that when installing in console mode. [Bug #1662835]

* lib/Conditions/WindowsConditions/RegistryTestCondition.condition
    Fixed a bug where checking for the existence of a registry key without
    a value would always return false.

* lib/file.tcl
    Fixed a bug where loading a project with a lot of files could take
    minutes to load. [Req #1665160]

* lib/install.tcl
    Fixed a bug where a small blank window would popup during silent installs
    on Windows.

* lib/installapi.tcl
    Added a default title and message for Prompt For Directory so that these
    strings can be localized in the future. [Req #1512658]

* lib/new.tcl
    Fixed a bug where new installs would inherit the application ID of the
    last install opened. [Bug #1689940]

* lib/preview.tcl
    Cleanup previews a little better.  Currently, if a preview fails, you
    can't do another one because of more errors. [Bug #1546595]

* lib/trees.tcl
    Fixed a bug where clicking twice on an install group would cause an
    error. [Bug #1665811]

* lib/uninstall.tcl
    Fixed a bug where a small blank window would popup during silent
    uninstalls on Windows.

* lib/utils.tcl
    Changed the popup when testing a modified project.  Now, instead of just
    asking whether you want to save and build, you have the option to quick
    build or do a full build. [Req #1664072]


2007-03-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where destroying a window could cause problems for
    other windows when looking for their parent. [Bug #1672859]


2007-02-22  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action
    Fixed a bug where the status virtual text was not being accurately
    set with the exit code from the external program.


2007-02-21  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
* lib/actions.tcl
* lib/file.tcl
* lib/utils.tcl
    Only show the aliases of actions when selecting from a list instead of
    showing object IDs that don't mean anything to the user. [Req #1664071]

* lib/build.tcl
* lib/gui-common.tcl
* lib/new.tcl
* lib/utils.tcl
* lib/virtualtext.tcl
    Added the ability to specify which languages to offer the user when
    they are allowed to select a language. [Req #1661645]

    If the user isn't allowed to select languages, don't package all of
    the message catalogs when building.

* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action
    Added new Watch Progressive Ouput property to watch the output of a
    program for special cues to InstallJammer.  This allows external programs
    to change the values of virtual text in InstallJammer when running for
    a long time so they can update messages and progress bars, etc...
    See the docs for more information on using this feature.

* lib/build.tcl
    Attempting to fix any case where stopping a build can put the builder into
    an unknown state. [Bug #1664102]

* lib/utils.tcl
    Fixed a bug where deleting a condition while still editing a property
    could cause an error in the condition editor. [Bug #1662683]

* lib/actions/ConsoleActions/ConsoleAskYesOrNo.action
* lib/conditions/UserInputConditions/AskYesOrNo.condition
    When using an Ask Yes or No condition in console mode, use Console Ask
    Yes or No as a means to get the answer instead of erroring out.  If we're
    in Silent mode, just return whatever is true. [Bug #1662835]

* lib/trees.tcl
    Fixed a bug where clicking twice on a grouping in the user interface
    tree (like attempting to rename) would cause an error. [Bug #1665811]

    *** InstallJammer 1.1.1 RELEASED ***


2007-02-14  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
* lib/build.tcl
* lib/dobuild.tcl
    Another fix to command-line builds on Linux.

* lib/build.tcl
    Make sure the installkit is writable before packaging files.
    [Req #1658482]


2007-02-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
* lib/utils.tcl
    Allow multiple file selection when adding files to a File Group.
    [Bug #1657047]

* lib/build.tcl
    Fixed a bug where command-line builds did not complete when storing
    solid archives. [Bug #1653941]

    Output errors for command-line builds even in quiet mode.

* installjammer
* lib/dobuild.tcl
    Fixed a bug where command-line builds from UNIX could not specify a
    relative project file name.

2007-02-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/SetVirualText.action
    Fixed a bug where the Substitute Value property of the Set Virtual
    Text action was being silently ignored. [Bug #1658071]


2007-02-07  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
* lib/cmdline.tcl
    Fixed a bug where Windows command-line builds would fail because they
    were requiring the wrong version of BWidgets. [Bug #1653713]


2007-02-06  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.1 RELEASED ***


2007-02-05  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
* lib/common.tcl
    *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
    Changed the search order of virtual text substitution to put
    language-specific text AFTER non-specific.  The language-specific
    text is actually less important than the non-specific because the
    non-specific is used in almost every virtual text variable throughout
    an install.

* lib/Actions/FileActions/ReadFileIntoVirtualText.action
    Added a Trim String property to the Read File Into Virtual Text action
    so that the data read from the file can be trimmed of excess whitespace.

* lib/Actions/FileActions/WriteTextToFile.action
    *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
    Changed the way Files are handled in the Write Text to File action.
    It doesn't make much sense for this action to accept a list of patterns.
    I can't imagine too many cases where you would this action in that
    manner.  Instead, the action now accepts an explicit list of files
    (not patterns) to write to.

    Added a new Add to Uninstall property to the Write Text to File action.

    Added a new Append Newline property to specify that the text to be
    written out should have a newline appended at the end.  This is the
    current behavior, so this value is defaulted to Yes.


2007-02-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/convert.tcl
    Added a new conversion for the next release that will scan through
    the install for License panes that have incorrect conditions and
    fix them.  There were several versions of InstallJammer that had
    buggy License panes.  This conversion will fix any that remain.

    Removed some of the older conversion routines for 1.0a1.

* lib/file.tcl
    Made the checkbuttons on the build tab match the active status of
    the platform on project loading.


2007-01-31  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* Themes/Modern_Wizard/Uninstall/Uninstall.pane
    Removed the message box and check for removing leftover files.
    Users will usually click this box to remove the rest of the
    components when they don't actually know what they're doing.
    It's better to leave a few directories lying around than end
    up deleting something important.

* lib/file.tcl
    Fixed a bug where creating a new project can fail and error
    while trying to save project preferences if the InstallJammer
    home directory does not already exist.


2007-01-30  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/build.tcl
    Fixed a bug in command-line builds that would result in an error.

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where a --version option on the command-line would error
    on Windows.

* lib/file.tcl
* lib/common.tcl
* lib/convert.tcl
    Building a project from the command-line that has not been converted
    to the new project format will result in an error telling the user they
    need to upgrade the project before building.


2007-01-29  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* installjammer
    Fixed a bug where the #!/bin/sh line got moved down in the installjammer
    script, and this causes it not to launch.


2007-01-24  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/LaunchFile.action
    Added an Arguments property to the Launch File action to pass arguments
    to the command-line when executing a file.


2007-01-23  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/main.tcl
    Moved the debug.log into the local InstallJammer home directory
    for each user instead of the local install directory.  When running
    on a multi-user UNIX system, the debug.log sometimes cannot be written.

* lib/Conditions/FilePermissionCondition.condition
    Fixed a bug that would cause InstallJammer to say that C:/ is not
    writable during installation when it actually is.

* lib/installapi.tcl
    Fixed a bug where the Choose Directory dialog would default to the
    wrong directory and would blank out when the user hit cancel.

* Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/License.pane
    Fixed a bug where the License pane was not disabling the Yes button
    on display.  The user could then proceed without ever agreeing to the
    license.

* lib/header.tcl
    Fixed a bug where typing into an entry would sometimes cause the first
    character typed to convert to a 0 or 1.  This was a bug in the
    auto-boolean code handling.

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/SetVirtualText.action
    Added a new "Auto Update" property to the Set Virtual Text action.  This
    just exposes the underlying function of what the API can already do.
    Setting a virtual text to Auto Update means that the screen should
    automatically be updated anytime the value changes.


2007-01-23  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>
    *** InstallJammer 1.1b2 RELEASED ***


2007-01-22  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/install.tcl
    Fixed a bug where an install would fail if the Default Setup Type
    did not exist in the installer.  InstallJammer will now pick the
    first Setup Type in the list if the default does not exist.

* Binaries/Windows/craplzma0.1/*
    Replaced the LZMA binaries on Windows with the proper ones.  This fixes
    errors that occur in installers that are compiled with LZMA on Windows.

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where InstallJammer would fail if it could not create its
    registry directory in Program Files on Windows.  If Program Files is
    not writable, InstallJammer will attempt to create its registry in
    the COMMON_APPDATA directory instead.


2007-01-17  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/main.tcl
    Turned off auto-update check by default until it's ready.

* lib/help.tcl
    Fixed a typo that causes a startup failure when the auto-update fails
    for some reason.

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where the help documentation for command line options was
    pointing to a non-existent page.

* lib/main.tcl
* lib/install.tcl
    Fixed a bug where the Default Language was not being written out to
    the installer.  This meant that even if a Default Language was specified,
    it was being ignored by the installer on startup.

* lib/builderapi.tcl
    Fixed a typo in ::BuilderAPI::GetAction.

    Fixed a bug where inactive conditions were still being saved to the
    install.

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where inactive conditions would still be executed.

* lib/Actions/FileActions/CreateFileLink.action
    Fixed a typo on Create File Link that would cause it to fail.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action
    Fixed a bug where inactive file groups would still be installed.

    Added some debug output when skipping a component, file group or file
    due to inactivity.


2006-10-26  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/file.tcl
* lib/common.tcl

    included in the installer and still executed during installation.
    [Bug #1585469]

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action
    Fixed a bug where inactive File Groups were still being installed.

    Added some debugging output when a Component, File Group or File is
    skipped.

* lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action
    Fixed a bug that would cause entry widgets in the Add Widget action
    to lose the connection to their virtual text.

    *** InstallJammer 1.0.4 RELEASED ***


2006-10-25  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* installjammer
    Updated the installjammer startup script to be able to handle
    64 bit Linux versions that report a different mach.

* Binaries/Windows/Wintcl/wintcl.tcl
    Strip any extra \'s off the front and back of a registry key
    before attempting to fetch it from the registry.

* lib/msgs/languages.txt
    Added Brazilian Portugese translations. (Thanks to Alan Carvalho de Assis!)

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/LogDebugMessage.action
    Added new Log Debug Message action for logging messages to
    the console and debug log when running in debug mode.

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/ModifyObject.action
    Added new Modify Object action.  Currently this can only be
    used to activate or deactivate an object, but this will be
    enhanced more in the future.

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/LaunchWebBrowser.action
    Launch Web Browser now attempts to use the desktop environment
    method of launching a URL on KDE and Gnome.  If these fail, or
    if we're in a different desktop environment, we will attempt to
    find a browser based on environment and known browsers.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action
    Report an error if the current setup type could not be found in
    our list of setup types.

    Exclude files that are inactive when building the list of files
    to install.  This can be used in conjunction with the new
    Modify Object action to disable certain files programmatically
    during installation.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallWindowsShortcut.action
    Added new Window State property to Install Windows Shortcut
    to specify the initial window state for the new shortcut.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallUninstaller.action
    Don't attempt to save aliases out with the uninstaller.  Aliases
    are dynamically built when the objects are created.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/UnpackStoredFile.action
    Added new Add to Uninstall property to Unpack Stored File action
    to specify that the file should not be added to the uninstall.

* lib/Actions/SystemActions
    Added new System Actions action category.

* lib/Actions/SystemActions/AddDirectoryToPath.action
    Added new Add Directory to Path action.  Currently Windows-only.

* lib/Actions/SystemActions/RemoveDirectoryFromPath.action
    Added new Remove Directory from Path action.  Currently Windows-only.

* lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action
    Check to see if the directory we're about to delete matches our
    <%Company%>.  If so, we won't attempt to delete it if it's not
    already empty.  Putting a Company directory in the path is a common
    thing on Windows, and we don't want to delete the whole directory
    if it's not empty, even if we're the ones who created it.

* lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsRegistryKey.action
    Added new Add to Uninstall property to Add Windows Registry Key
    action to specify that a key should not be added to the uninstall.

* lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsUninstallEntry.action
    Fixed a bug where installing the Windows uninstall registry entry
    could fail if we don't have permission to write to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
    If it fails, we'll try and write to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER uninstall
    registry instead. [Bug #1578278]

* lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddPaneToOrder.action
    Added new Add Pane to Order action.  This action will add a given
    pane to the back order of the wizard.

* lib/Actions/WizardActions/MoveToPane.action
    The Move to Pane action now adds the new pane to the back order of
    the wizard so that if the user moves back, the order of the panes
    is exactly as it was when they went forward.

* lib/Actions/WizardActions/RemovePaneFromOrder.action
    Added new Remove Pane from Order action.  This action will remove a
    given pane from the back order of the wizard.

* lib/Actions/WizardActions/AddWidget.action
    Added entry box as a possible widget type for the Add Widget
    action.

    Fixed a bug where radiobuttons with a Value that looked like
    a boolean would not work properly.  Value is now checked to see
    if it looks like a boolean and auto-converted before creating
    the radiobutton.

* lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl
    Fixed a bug where clicking the X on the Choose Directory dialog
    would cause an erorr.

    Fixed several other bugs that make the dialog act more like it's
    supposed to.

* lib/BWidget/messagedlg.tcl
    Added right and left keyboard traversal to buttons in message dialogs.

* lib/common.tcl
* lib/BWidget/wizard.tcl
    Fixed a bug where skipping a pane because its conditions fail would
    cause the actions of the pane being skipped to be executed anyway.
    When skipping a pane, the actions of that pane should be completely
    ignored.

* lib/Conditions/FileExistsCondition.condition
* lib/Conditions/FilePermissionCondition.condition
* lib/Conditions/PlatformCondition.condition
* lib/Conditions/StringEqualCondition.condition
* lib/Conditions/StringIsCondition.condition
* lib/Conditions/StringMatchCondition.condition
    Added debug messages to many conditions to make debugging easier.

* lib/file.tcl
* lib/build.tcl
    Comment properties are now excluded when building unless debugging
    options are included.

* lib/common.tcl
    Added many more options to the debug output.  Debug lines are now
    output with a date/time stamp.  Any debug output that contains
    virtual text will automatically be substituted and output on the
    next line so that someone can tell what the original text was and
    what the actual text was.

    When debugging, any comment on an object will automatically be
    output along with any other debugging for that object.  This means
    that a developer's comments can be easily seen in debug mode.

    Added a lot of debugging output to actions and conditions as they
    execute.

    *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***
    Fixed a bug where substituting virtual text would bomb when trying
    to substitute text with unmatched []'s.  This was causing failures
    on Japanese machines where the characters were interpreted incorrectly.

    This is potentially incompatible for developers who were previously
    using Tcl commands inside of virtual text.  This DOES NOT apply to
    things like Execute Script that already do the proper substitution,
    but if you were trying to use Tcl commands in the midst of regular
    text, it will no longer work.

    Panes that are marked inactive (like through a Modify Object action)
    are now skipped just as if their conditions had failed.

2006-09-19  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/build.tcl
* lib/common.tcl
* lib/install.tcl
* lib/uninstall.tcl
    Fixed a bug where Silent installs still needed a GUI environment to run.
    Silent installs should run successfully now with no GUI environment
    present.

* lib/msgs/installer/de.msg
* Themes/Classic_Wizard/de.msg
* Themes/Modern_Wizard/de.msg
    Added German translations (thanks to Hans Hellwege!).

* lib/main.tcl
* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallWindowsShortcut.action
    Made some minor changes to fix bugs and make InstallJammer work on Win 9x.

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where including the TWAPI extension did not actually
    load it into the installer.

    Make sure we don't load TWAPI on a system less than Windows XP.


2006-09-18  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

I haven't been tracking my changes very well over the last few weeks, so
all of these changes fall on the same day, but they were coded over the
last month or so.

* lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsFileType.action
    Fixed a typo that would cause an error when the Icon Path was specified.
    [Bug #1533420]

* lib/trees-filegroup.tcl
    Fixed a bug where some user systems don't have the %c time format
    available.  We'll use a long-hand version from now on.  This would cause
    an error on some systems when selecting a file in the File Group tree.
    [Bug #1545596]

    Fixed a bug where just clicking on a File Group name would cause it
    to go into rename edit mode.

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where COMMON_* directories don't work on Windows 9x.  From
    now on, we'll try to use the specific counterpart if the COMMON was not
    found. [Bug #1551016]

    Modified the Script Condition to allow Tcl commands and variables
    within the script.

    Fixed a bug where the "Update files with more recent date" check was
    not accurately comparing files whose dates were identical.  In those
    cases, the files would be installed anyway when they should be ignored.

* lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsRegistryKey.action
    Fixed a bug where the Root Key was being ignored for registry keys
    when added via this action. [Bug #1557936]

* lib/utils.tcl
    Fixed a bug where editing the text of certain properties could cause
    an error when trying to save. [Bug #1533009]

* lib/build.tcl
    Store message catalogs in the install during a quick build.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallWindowsShortcut.action
    Added a check to see if the target of a Windows Shortcut looks like a
    URL to allow URL shortcuts to be created. [Reported by Paul Holmes-Higgin]

* lib/Actions/FileActions
    Added new File Actions group with the following actions:

    Adjust Line Feeds
    Backup File
    Change File Ownership
    Change File Permissions
    Copy File
    Create File Link
    Delete File
    Read File Into Virtual Text
    Rename File
    Replace Text In File
    Write Text To File

    *** InstallJammer 1.0.2 RELEASED ***


2006-08-01  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* Binaries/*/installkit
    Replaced the Windows installkit with a new one that includes a new
    command to create Windows shortcuts and is also 500k smaller thanks
    to Jeremy Collake's PECompact2. [Bug #1532013]

    Replaced the Linux installkit with a new non-threaded build.  This
    means that Linux installs will no longer use threads, but it also
    means that the Linux installs will no longer rely on the pthread
    library on the target system. [Bug #1525293]


2006-07-29  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsFileType.action
    Fixed a bug in Add Windows File Type that caused it to fail
    on an invalid command. [Bug #1530808]


2006-07-28  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/unpack.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause non-threaded installs to not install any
    files.


2006-07-26  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/BWidget/wizard.tcl
    If the pane changes while moving forward or backward (like due to
    a Move to Pane action), we want to stop moving because the pane
    has changed. [Bug #1526114]

* lib/file.tcl
* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Record if the main InstallJammer window is maximized on Windows and
    restore that state when restarting InstallJammer.


2006-07-21  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteScript.action
    Fixed a bug where Execute Script would not accurately report
    back an error. [Bug #1521867]


2006-07-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/trees-filegroup.tcl
    Changed the way multiple selection in the File Group tree works
    when using shift-click.  InstallJammer will now select all of
    the nodes between two shift-click'd nodes regardless of their
    parent. [Reported by Scott Specker]

    Fixed a bug where the Alias property was not reflecting the correct
    value when switching between nodes in the File Group tree. [Bug #1521556]


2006-07-05  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/new.tcl
    Hooked up the Help button on the New Project Wizard to open the
    Step-by-Step tutorial for creating a new project.

    *** InstallJammer 1.0.1 RELEASED ***


2006-07-05  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl
* lib/BWidget/choosefile.tcl
    The Choose File and Choose Directory dialogs now include hidden
    files and directories.


2006-07-04  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/file.tcl
* lib/trees-filegroup.tcl
    Fixed a bug that caused InstallJammer to ignore hidden files when
    building lists of files and directories for packaging.
    [Reported by Juan Tejo]


2006-06-30  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where InstallJammer could create a temporary directory
    as root and then not be able to install later as non-root. [Bug #1513795]


2006-06-25  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/trees-filegroup.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause files added in directories that
    are a direct child of a Windows drive to lose a / and make
    the files install in the wrong place. [Bug #1511627]

* lib/Actions/JavaActions/LocateJavaRuntime.action
    Fixed a bug that would cause an error if we were looking for a
    JRE on a Windows system that had never installed one. [Bug #1511871]

    Fixed a bug that caused InstallJammer to not recognize versions
    properly for a Blackdown Java JRE (they use - instead of _). [Bug #1511881]

* lib/common.tcl
* lib/virtualtext.tcl
    Fixed a bug where adding a new virtual text with no value would not
    get saved. [Bug #1511599]

    Fixed a bug where renaming a virtual text variable was not saving
    properly. [Bug #1509526]

    Fixed a bug where the error dialog when renaming or adding virtual
    text could get into a weird state if the user was doing a bunch of
    weird stuff.  Instead, we just post the error dialog and cancel the
    edit to stop the whole process. [Bug #1509526]

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where InstallJammer was not setting the modified time of
    a file after it was installed on the target system.  This meant that
    every file installed had the current date/time instead of what was
    stored in the installer. [Bug #1505025]

* lib/trees-filegroup.tcl
    Fixed a bug where the Active property of a node in the File Group tree
    could get out of synch with its check image. [Bug #1505408]

* lib/cmdlin.tcl
    Fixed a bug where building from the command line would include files
    and directories that were marked as inactive in a project.
    [Reported by J Portman]

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where auto-complete typing was turned on for the Help Browser
    combobox in the Preferences dialog.  This was causing the user not to
    be able to type the location of a help browser.

    Fixed a bug where the Cancel button on the Preferences dialog didn't
    actually reset the preferences. [Bug #1508941]

* lib/main.tcl
* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where specifying the Default Language was not working
    properly during installation.  If Allow Language Selection is No,
    the Default Language will always be used.  If Allow Language Selection
    is Yes, InstallJammer will first attempt to determine the user's system
    language, and if available, use that as the default in the language select
    dialog.  If InstallJammer cannot determine the system language (or if it
    is one we don't have), the language select dialog will default to Default
    Language. [Bug #1510750]

* lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl
    Clicking outside of the entry while making a new folder in the Choose
    Directory dialog will now finish the edit instead of reverting its text.
    [Bug #1510752]

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where executing some actions before the first pane is
    displayed would cause an error.  InstallJammer was attempting to
    update the widgets on the pane when there was no pane to update.

    *** InstallJammer 1.0 RELEASED ***


2006-06-15  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteScript.action
    Fixed a bug that was causing the result virtual text not to be set
    after the script was executed.


2006-05-26  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/tkcheck.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause user input into an entry field to be
    substituted as a boolean (0 or 1) value as they are typing.

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause files that have been installed previously
    to fail when trying to install over them.

* lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause the Make New Folder button on the Choose
    Directory dialog to fail.

* lib/BWidget/tablelist.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause the virtual text table to error when
    switching between languages if an edit was currently active.


2006-05-23  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

    *** InstallJammer 1.0rc3 RELEASED ***


2006-05-19  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/msgs/installer/*.msg
* Themes/*/theme.tcl
* Themes/*/*.msg
    Added some translations for strings that were missing in the last
    release.


2006-05-18  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/BWidget/choosedir.tcl
    Modified the Choose Directory dialog to show drives on Windows so that
    the user can change to a different drive.

* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action
    Fixed a bug that would cause an error if the virtual text variables
    in an Execute External Program action were blank.

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where the Unpack Stored File action could cause an error
    if the file failed to install.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/UnpackStoredFile.action
    Unpack Stored File will no longer respect the File Update Method for
    the given file.  This isn't very intuitive anyway, and the action can
    always have its own conditions if it needs them.


2006-05-17  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/BWidget/wizard.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause the wizard to fail on some platforms
    with an error about "wm resizable ..."

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/UnpackStoredFile.action
    Fixed a bug in the Unpack Stored File action.


2006-05-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/class.tcl
    Fixed a bug where the text label for text properties was prepending
    the word Edit to every label.

* Themes/*/Install/UserInformation.tcl
    Fixed the virtual text variables for the user info panes.  The variables
    used now are: <%UserInfoName%> and <%UserInfoCompany%>

* lib/utils.tcl
* lib/common.tcl
* lib/preview.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause an unrecognized error if there was an
    actual error while trying to preview a pane.  The message box would
    never come up and instead come up with an error that doesn't actually
    tell you what the problem is.

* lib/new.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause an error when creating a new install if
    you don't go all the way to the last screen.


2006-05-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/main.tcl
* lib/build.tcl
    Fixed a bug that was causing failure in command-line builds. [Bug 1486397]

* lib/main.tcl
* lib/cmdline.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause message boxes to error on Windows during
    a command-line build.  Since Windows doesn't have a console we can
    output to, we use message dialogs instead to let the user know when
    something happens.

* lib/build.tcl
    Changed the output of the info array for virtual text.

    Made the build files write out with UNIX linefeeds.  We don't need the
    extra \r that Windows puts in, and Tcl will handle it either way.


2006-05-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

    *** InstallJammer 1.0rc2 RELEASED ***


2006-05-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/main.tcl
    Fixed a startup bug that would only occur on systems that had never
    had InstallJammer run before.

* lib/class.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause the titles of panes to become corrupted
    after deleting a pane and adding new ones.  Very obscure bug.


2006-05-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

    *** InstallJammer 1.0rc1 RELEASED ***

2006-05-08  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/common.tcl
* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action
    Fixed a bug in Execute External Program where having a file name
    with spaces or backslahes would cause the execute to fail because
    of string translation.  This only happened when showing progressive
    output.

* lib/help.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause an error if a user clicked the About
    InstallJammer button more than once.

* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteScript.action
    Execute scripts at the global level.

    Added Result Virtual Text property to Execute Script to store the
    result of the script in the specified virtual text.


2006-05-05  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Fixed a bug that was causing paned windows in the install builder
    to not use the saved geometry from the last session.  The paned
    windows should now all remember their locations between sessions.

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Focus to the virtual text table after selecting a new language.

* lib/new.tcl
* lib/utils.tcl
* lib/Themes/*/theme.tcl
    Added new additional feature to the new install wizard to allow
    users to select custom components during installation.  If this
    option is checked, InstallJammer adds the panes to the installer
    to allow the user to select setup type and custom components.
    

2006-05-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/build.tcl
* lib/common.tcl
    Removed the individual platform package directories in favor of a
    single InstallJammer package.  Each platform can still have its
    own package directory in the future though.

* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action
    Added a Working Directory property to Execute External Program
    that specifies what directory to be in when starting up the
    external program.  InstallJammer will remain in that directory
    until the external application finishes executing.

* lib/new.tcl
    Made the Launch Application action in new installs default to
    <%InstallDir%> as its working directory.


2006-05-02  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/main.tcl
    Store Allow Language Selection in the install so that the installer
    will respect its value.  Previously, setting this to No would still
    prompt the user for language.

* lib/utils.tcl
    When modifying the value of a file property, trim the result of whitespace.


2006-04-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/editor.tcl
    Fixed a bug where clicking the X on the text editor would cause an error.

* Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/License.tcl
    Fixed a bug where the radiobuttons on the license pane were not reflecting
    state properly. [Bug 1477233]

* lib/new.tcl
    Check to make sure the project directory we're about create doesn't
    already exist when creating a new project.

* lib/file.tcl
* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Re-added an option to Skip Unused File Groups in the Install Features
    that tells InstallJammer to not pack file groups that are not contained
    in at least one component.  There are times when we need to pack files
    that really aren't part of the install at all.


2006-04-23  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* Themes/*/Common/setup.tcl
    Fixed a bug that was causing pieces of the installers to not all share
    the same background color.  This would cause the installers to look
    odd on most UNIX platforms because the colors didn't match.


2006-04-19  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

    *** InstallJammer 1.0b2 RELEASED ***


2006-04-19  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/help.tcl
    When opening the Windows help file, open to the correct help topic.

    Fixed the handling of a blank help browser on Windows.  InstallJammer
    will execute the default web browser for the system.


2006-04-13  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/common.tcl
    Removed the -index argument for Install Components.  They are no longer
    saved with the project.  Instead, components are placed in their parents
    in the order they are added in the file.


2006-04-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/install.tcl
    When browsing for the install dir during installation, we no longer
    append our directory to the end of what the user chooses.  They do,
    however, have the option to make a new folder on the target system
    for installing into.

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where Platform Information was not accurately being updated
    when closing and opening install projects.

* lib/new.tcl
    Fixed a bug where some information was not being saved for some platforms
    if they were not active in the new project.


2006-03-29  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/SetVirtualText.action
    Added new Set Virtual Text action to set the value of a
    virtual text variable in a specified language.


2006-03-23  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/Exit.action
    Added a new Exit Type property to the Exit action that specifies
    whether we're exiting on a Cancel or Finish condition.  This mostly
    affects what actions InstallJammer will take during exit, including
    whether the Finish Actions or Cancel Actions action group is called.

* lib/BWidget/properties.tcl
    Fixed a bug where hitting Escape while editing a property
    in the Conditions Editor would actually cause the window to close.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/CheckForPreviousInstall.action
    Added new Check for Previous Install action that sets the
    variables <%PreviousInstallExists%> and <%PreviousInstallDir%>.


2006-03-22  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/common.tcl
    Added Temp and InstallInfoDir explicitly to the list of
    virtual text so that if the installer tries to use them
    before InstallJammer itself has, the directories will be
    created and established correctly.

    Added checks to make sure files in the Temp and InstallInfoDir
    directories don't get written out to the install log.  These
    directories are automatically cleaned up by InstallJammer anyway.

* lib/common.tcl
* lib/uninstall.tcl
* lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action
    An uninstaller will now check for an install.log file in the
    InstallJammer info directory if it can't find one stored inside
    itself.

    Make sure the uninstall deletes the InstallJammer info directory
    when everything else is done.  No need to leave it lying around.

* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteScript.action
* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action
* lib/Conditions/GeneralConditions/ScriptCondition.condition
* lib/Conditions/StringConditions/StringEqualCondition.condition
* lib/Conditions/StringConditions/StringMatchCondition.condition
    Changed actions and conditions with text properties that
    referred to scripts and code into regular properties.  Since
    text properties are now localized by language, these scripts
    would have been only set in a single language and wouldn't
    work if the user changed languages during installation.

* lib/class.tcl
* lib/utils.tcl
    Fixed a bug in editing a text property of a condition.  An error would
    occur when trying to finish the edit.

* lib/BWidget/tablelist.tcl
    Fixed a bug where double-clicking between two rows in a tablelist
    would cause an error.

* lib/BWidget/wizard.tcl
* Themes/Modern_Wizard/Common/CustomBlankPane1.pane
* Themes/Modern_Wizard/Common/CustomBlankPane1.tcl
    Removed the separator from the Custom Blank Pane 1 of the Modern
    Wizard and added a separator underneath the image and text box.
    This looks more like other modern wizards. [Req 1453799]


2006-03-21  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/common.tcl
    Added FileBeingInstalled to the list of virtual text to be normalized.

    Added new <%Tail filename%> virtual text to get the tail end of a
    file path.

* lib/file.tcl
* lib/common.tcl
* lib/trees-filegroup.tcl
    Directory objects now store their directory as the actual directory
    path instead of the directory to be created in.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallDesktopShortcut.action
    Added new Install Desktop Shortcut action.  Does exactly what
    the other install shortcut actions do except that it will automatically
    install the shortcut on the target desktop for every supported window
    manager available.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/UnpackStoredFile.action
    Added new Unpack Stored File action that will unpack a file stored in
    the installer to a specified location.

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/LaunchWebBrowser.action
    Added new Launch Web Browser action that opens a web browser to a
    specified URL.


2006-03-20  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/trees.tcl
    Fixed a bug where editing the name of a file group would cause
    an error when trying to save the new name. [Bug 1453794]

* lib/trees-setuptype.tcl
    Fixed a bug where creating a new Setup Type would cause an error.
    [Bug 1453794]

* lib/Themes/*/*/*.tcl
    Changed the display of embedded textboxes.  Instead of making the
    entire frame with scrollbars appear sunken, we only make the textbox
    itself appear sunken. [Req 1453799]

* lib/build.tcl
    Output all boolean variables in the info array as 0 or 1 depending.
    This is cleaner for the implementation of checkbuttons in a wizard.

* Themes/*/Install/SelectProgramFolder.tcl
    Added a checkbutton to the Select Program Folder pane to let the
    user install the program folder for all users instead of just
    the current.

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Added new Install Program Folder for All Users property for Windows
    platforms.


2006-03-19  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/utils.tcl
* lib/class.tcl
* lib/trees-filegroup.tcl
    Added new options for files and directories so that every directory
    or file in an install can be customized with properties.

* lib/new.tcl
    When adding the default application directory, just add the directory
    as one and set the Destination Directory to <%InstallDir%> instead of
    adding all the files contained in the directory.  This will achieve
    the same effect of having the application install in the root install
    directory.

* lib/Themes/*/*/*.tcl
    Made all text boxes in the install themes wrap on a word instead of
    on a single character.

* lib/main.tcl
* lib/install.tcl
* lib/gui-common.tcl
* lib/virtualtext.tcl
    Removed the Enable InstallJammer Version System option.  We're going
    to always save the versions from now on.

* lib/utils.tcl
    Fixed a bug where testing an install that needed to be rebuilt would
    cause an error due to a missing command.  We now wait until the rebuild
    is done before proceeding with the test.


2006-03-19  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/utils.tcl
* lib/common.tcl
* lib/virtualtext.tcl
    Added support for multiple languages in installers.  A few more
    things to do in this area, but the support is there.

* lib/utils.tcl
    Fixed a bug where some properties would not get saved when
    switching from one component to the next.

* lib/preview.tcl
    Save the active component before previewing so that we get all
    of the latest changes into the preview window.

* lib/new.tcl
* lib/install.tcl
    Added new default Action Groups for cancel and finish.  These groups
    are called before the installer completes, but they are not attached
    to any specified pane or action.

    Removed Startup Actions from the welcome pane.  This action group
    now gets called at the startup no matter what.

* lib/install.tcl
    Added a --prefix option to installs that lets the user specify the
    install directory prefix from the command-line.


2006-03-15  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/install.tcl
* Themes/*/Install/SelectProgram
    Populate Program Folders from a single proc instead of putting
    the code directory in the panes.  Added a SetProgramFolder proc
    to setup the program folder instead of setting the variable
    directly.


2006-03-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/utils.tcl
* lib/build.tcl
* lib/common.tcl
    Changed the default file extension on non-Windows systems from .bin
    to nothing.  Most Linux systems seem to recognize that executable
    files just shouldn't have an extension.

* lib/file.tcl
* lib/gui-common.tcl
    InstallJammer will now remember the sizes of the panedwindows
    on the main screens in the builder.

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Made the default geometry for InstallJammer 800x600 instead of
    1024x768 for those poor sods who are still running on lower
    resolution machines.  The guys on the larger screens can always
    make it bigger.

* lib/build.tcl
    Made quick build spit out the correct build time for each
    platform instead of just the overall build time.

    Fixed a bug where trying to exit while building would cause an
    error because of a bad proc name.  Still can't exit or close
    a project during a build.  That's yet to come.

* lib/install.tcl
    Normalize the home directory for .installjammerinfo on UNIX
    platforms.  Storing ~/.installjammerinfo in the install.log
    was causing errors during uninstallation.


2006-03-09  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/new.tcl
    Changed the way project name and project directory are handled
    when creating a new project.  An InstallJammer project must always
    be created in its own subdirectory since it does a lot of things
    during building that we don't want to conflict with any directories
    that may already exist.

* lib/BWidget/properties.tcl
    Fixed a bug where an error while editing properties could cause
    another error when clicking to another cell.

    Fixed a bug where double-clicking on a row border would cause the
    table columns to auto-resize.

* lib/utils.tcl
    Editing a version node now just has a standard entry, but it expects
    the user to enter a valid version in the format of X.X.X.X.  An error
    occurs if the version is invalid.  The field can also accept virtual
    text that is also checked for a valid version.

* lib/BWidget/preferences.tcl
    Fixed a bug in Preference widgets where -treewidth and -pagewidth
    were not being accurately reported.

* lib/BWidget/panedw.tcl
    Fixed a recursive bug in PanedWindow.


2006-03-08  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where the <%Username%> virtual text was not getting
    set properly when the user was root.  By virtue of this, the
    Require Root option was not working properly because InstallJammer
    never thought anyone was root unless they had actually logged into
    the session as root.

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Made the toolbar icons 22x22 instead of 16x16.  I just like it better
    that way. 0-]

    Added code to modify the current help topic depending on what screen
    the user is currently on.

    Hooked up the Help button on the toolbar to the current help topic.

    Hooked up F1 to the current help topic.


2006-03-03  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/build.tcl
* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Removed the build option to save main.tcl.  The build files are now
    always saved in a build/ subdirectory in the project directory.
    
    Removed the build option to rebuild without repackaging files.

    Added a Quick Build toolbar button that rebuilds the installer files
    and stores them in the installer without repackaging all of the
    actual application files.

    Added a checkbutton to the Build screen to build installers for
    final release.  This option disables the debugging options in the
    installer and turns off a few other things so that the installers
    produced are ready for final distribution.


2006-03-02  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/new.tcl
* lib/main.tcl
* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Added new Short Application Name (<%ShortAppName%>) virtual text.

    Added new Application URL (<%ApplicationURL%>) virtual text.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action
* lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action
    Added new <%Status%> virtual text to more accurately reflect
    what InstallJammer is doing throughout the installation.  This
    variable is being used in place of <%FileBeingInstalledText%>
    in most cases.

* Themes/Modern_Wizard/*
    Moved all of the text strings out of the individual panes and
    into en.msg.  Adding new languages should be much easier with
    all the text in one place.


2006-02-27  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* Binaries/*/installkit
    Upgraded installkit to threaded builds when available on a platform.

* lib/build.tcl
* lib/common.tcl
* lib/unpack.tcl
* lib/install.tcl
    Modified InstallJammer build and install processes to use threads
    instead of executing an external process.  This will save us the
    overhead of always starting a new process.

    Install builds are now almost twice as fast as the last release.
    Installation should see a pretty good speed-up as well.
    

2006-02-25  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* Binaries/*/installkit
    Fixed a bug where files with non-ASCII characters in the filename
    would cause a failure when building an installer.  All filenames
    should be acceptable now.

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where installing a 0 byte file on Windows would fail.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallWishBinary.action
    Fixed Install Wish Binary action.  It had some old code that wasn't
    previously working.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallWrappedScript.action
    Fixed Install Wrapped Script action.  This wasn't really working
    at all.

    Added new Windows Resource properties to this action.


2006-02-22  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where InstallJammer was not respecting the File Update Method
    of a file group.  All installs were using the default to check for newer
    files by date.

    Fixed a bug where checking for files with newer dates was not usually
    accurate.  We now record the mtime of each file when building the
    install and use that for comparison.

* Themes/*/Uninstall/Uninstall.pane
    Fixed a bug in the default action.  When the user was asked if they
    wanted to remove ALL components, yes meant no and no meant yes.


2006-02-15  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/build.tcl
    Removed some superfluous update calls from the build so that
    builds move faster.

* lib/common.tcl
* lib/install.tcl
* lib/uninstall.tcl
* lib/virtualtext.tcl
    Cleaned up virtual text handling a lot so that any virtual text
    that is not considered reserved by InstallJammer can be overwritten
    in the virtual text definitions of a project.


2006-02-14  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/CopyFiles.pane
    Renamed FileValue widget to FileLabel.

* lib/file.tcl
* lib/build.tcl
* lib/dobuild.tcl
    Changed the way virtual text and strings are handled when building
    and loading projects in order to support Unicode characters in a
    project.  Full language support will happen in v1.1, but this will
    at least let users use whatever characters they want without us
    getting in their way.

* lib/virtualtext.tcl
    Removed standard virtual text from the Virtual Text screen.  We now
    only list the virtual text that has been added to the project.

* lib/build.tcl
    Removed RootDir, BinDir and LibDir virtual text.  They are no longer
    really needed for anything.


2006-02-13  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/Actions/WindowsRegistryActions/AddWindowsFileCommand.action
    Fixed a typo that would cause the Add Windows File Command action
    to fail everytime.

* lib/common.tcl
    Adjusted read_file to always read files in utf-8 by default.

    Removed the -label option from GetText.  We no longer substitute
    \n to \\n in labels in InstallJammer.

    Added the ability to substitute message catalog text as a virtual
    text variable.  For example, <%PaneID,BackButton%> will return
    the Back Button text value for the pane identified by PaneID.


2006-02-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/BWidget/wizard.tcl
    Adjusted the padding of the bottom separator in the wizard.

* Themes/Modern_Wizard/*/init.tcl
    Adjusted the wizard height to account for the new separator padding.

    Added InstallJammer text to the wizard separator.


2006-02-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

    *** InstallJammer 1.0b1 RELEASED ***


2006-02-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* Binaries/*/installkit
    Updated the installkits to the latest 8.4.12 release of Tcl/Tk.

    Cleaned up some code to speed up wrapping of installs.

    Wrapping now supports updating the Windows File Version for
    executables so that hovering over the installer in Explorer will
    display the correct version of the application.


2006-02-08  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/uninstall.tcl
    Fixed a bug where uninstall directories on Windows were not
    getting cleaned up properly on subsequent installations.

* lib/utils.tcl
    Fixed a bug where \n would get saved as a literal \n in text properties.


2006-02-02  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/MessagePanel.action
    Fixed a bug that would cause a message panel to be hidden
    if it was displayed before the wizard was up.

* lib/Actions/JavaActions/LocateJavaRuntime.action
    Added new Locate Java Runtime action to find the best available
    Java runtime on the target system.

* lib/Actions/JavaActions/GetJavaProperty.action
    Added new Get Java Property action to get the value of a property
    from a Java properties file.

* lib/Actions/GeneralActions/Wait.action
    Added a Wait action that will wait a specified amount of time
    before proceeding with the install.


2006-02-01  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/conditions.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause the confirmation message dialog to
    disappear behind the condition editor when deleting a condition.

* lib/install.tcl
    Fixed a bug where require root was calling the wrong exit if the user
    was not root.

* lib/build.tcl
    Cleaned up the build messages a little.


2006-01-31  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/build.tcl
    Executables are now built into an output subdirectory of the project
    directory.  This puts all of the installers into a single directory
    without any other files.  More stuff will go in here later.

* lib/trees-component.tcl
* lib/trees-filegroup.tcl
* lib/trees-setuptype.tcl
    Fixed a bug that was causing InstallJammer to not remember the Build
    Platforms for file groups, components and setup types upon reloading.


2006-01-23  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Split the preferences dialog into two tabs.


2006-01-22  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/BWidget/tablelist.tcl
    Added the ability to tab through fields when editing Virtual Text.


2006-01-19  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/common.tcl
* lib/install.tcl
    Set ProgramFolder during common init.  We don't need a proc.


2006-01-18  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/file.tcl
* lib/build.tcl
    Automatically remove unused file groups and components when building
    an install.  If a component includes a file group that was not saved
    because it was inactive or for any other reason, the file group will
    be removed from the component's list of file groups before building.

    A warning message is output in the build log explaining that the
    file group or component was removed during build.

* lib/Actions/WizardActions/ModifyWidget.action
    The Widget property can be a semicolon (;) separated list of widgets
    instead of always being just one.  This allows a single Modify Widget
    action to change several widgets at once. IE: Back Button; Next Button


2006-01-17  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/trees-filegroup.tcl
    Added the ability to set permissions across multiple file and file
    group selections.


2006-01-16  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/file.tcl
* lib/utils.tcl
* lib/themes.tcl
    Added the ability to edit a pane's creation code.  The new code is
    saved in the project directory in a created Theme subdirectory.  This
    is functionality that was already in place but was previously taken
    out to be reworked.

    Added new "Edit Pane Code" and "Restore Original Pane" buttons to each
    pane property window.


2006-01-14  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/Actions/WizardActions/ModifyWidget.action
    *** INCOMPATIBILITY ***
    Added a new Modify Widget action that replaces the Modify Button action.
    All uses of Modify Button throughout the different themes have been
    changed to Modify Widget.

    The Modify Button action has been removed.

* lib/Actions/ExecuteActions/ExecuteExternalProgram.action
    Added a property to specify a widget to update with output from the
    external program while running.  The widget must be a text box, and
    it will auto-scroll as output becomes available.

    Modified the way this action reads from stdout.  Instead of reading
    line-by-line, the data is now read as it becomes available and immediately
    updated in the progress widget.  This makes it possible to execute
    configure and make actions from the installer, and the output will
    continually updated in the text box as it builds.

* lib/build.tcl
    We don't auto-scroll the build log window if the user has scrolled up
    to read something else.


2006-01-12  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/file.tcl
* lib/trees-filegroup.tcl
    *** INCOMPATIBILITY ***
    Changed the way directories added to file groups work.  Instead of
    treating the root directory as being installed into the file group
    directory, every directory in a file group has its directory created.

    This gives a more consistent approach to directories in file groups.
    What you see is what you get.  All directories in a file group will
    be created just as you see them in the file group display.  Think of
    the file group as the root directory created when installing, and every
    directory contained in the file group will be created underneath it.

    This is more in-line with how other installers work as well as how most
    people would expect it to work.


2006-01-11  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/trees-filegroup.tcl
    Added right-click menu options on files to "Add to Windows Desktop" and
    "Add to Program Folder."  This makes it a lot easier to add a desktop or
    program folder link for any file in an install.

* lib/main.tcl
* lib/class.tcl
* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Added new UNIX platform options for "Default File Permission" and
    "Default Directory Permission."

* lib/utils.tcl
* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Added automatic scrollbars to the main project list.


2006-01-10  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/trees-component.tcl
    Added the ability to drag-and-drop components to change their order.
    This will affect the order components appear on the tree when choosing
    components for a custom install.

* lib/trees-setuptype.tcl
    Added the ability to drag-and-drop setup types to change their order.
    This will affect the order of setup types on the screen when the user
    is allowed to select a setup type.

* lib/class.tcl
* lib/install.tcl
    Added an option to specify that a component is required.  Required
    components cannot be deselected when the user is choosing components
    in a custom install.


2006-01-09  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where the "Execute Action" action would not work if it
    specified a target action that was not an Action Group.  Execute Action
    can now execute a single action as well as an Action Group.

    Set <%Username%> in CommonInit for both install and uninstall.

* lib/install.tcl
    Don't set <%InstallDir%> to <%RootInstallDir%> if it is empty.

* lib/uninstall.tcl
    Check for <%RequireRoot%> and require a root user to uninstall if
    it was also required for installation.


2005-12-08  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* Themes/Modern_Wizard/*/*.tcl
* Themes/Classic_Wizard/*/*.tcl
    Went through all of the important widgets in the install themes and
    made sure their text could be modified from within the install builder.


2005-12-07  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* Themes/Modern_Wizard/Common/defaults.tcl
* Themes/Classic_Wizard/Common/defaults.tcl
    Fixed a bug that would cause the Icon and Image variables to be
    overwritten anytime a project was loaded. [Bug 1367770]

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallSelectedFiles.action
    Fixed a bug where de-selecting a component in a Custom install
    would not disable it during installation.

* lib/cmdline.tcl
    Fixed a bug that was causing command-line builds to fail. [Bug 1374874]

* lib/uninstall.tcl
* Themes/Modern_Wizard/Common/main.tcl
* Themes/Classic_Wizard/Common/main.tcl
    Added ::InstallJammer::UninstallMain to handle the default uninstall
    actions for any theme.

    Center the uninstall window when uninstallation begins.

* lib/Actions/InstallActions/InstallWindowsShortcut.action
    If the target of the Windows shortcut does not exist, do not install one.
    [Bug 1370423]

* Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/SelectDestination.tcl
* Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/SelectDestination.pane
    Updated to allow configuration of the "Destination Folder" label.
    [Bug 1370424]

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Added a button to explore test installs to the main toolbar.


2005-11-21  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/install.tcl
    Set <%Username%> to the current system username.

    Check for <%RequireRoot%> and display an error and exit if the user is
    not root.

    If user is root, set <%InstallDir%> to the value of <%RootInstallDir%>.

    Decide which directory to store install info in based on whether the
    user is root or not.  If the user is root, store install info in
    /var/lib/installjammer.  If not, store it in ~/.installjammerinfo

* lib/common.tcl
    Fixed a bug where dialogs would sometimes not center to the screen.


2005-11-17  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/class.tcl
* lib/gui-common.tcl
    Added RequireRoot and RootInstallDir parameters to UNIX installs.


2005-11-16  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/gui-common.tcl
    The browse button for Windows Icon was using the wrong button style.


2005-11-14  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

* lib/install.tcl
    Changed SetInstallDir to record the original install dir and then
    append the tail end of the original install dir to the new install dir.

* lib/Actions/UninstallActions/UninstallSelectedFiles.action
    Don't perform registry actions on UNIX.  They don't do anything
    anyway, but the user still sees the message that we're uninstalling
    registry entries.  That could offend some UNIX people. 0-]

* lib/BWidget/properties.tcl
    Fixed a bug where escaping while editing could sometimes cause an error.

* lib/gui-common.tcl
* lib/utils.tcl
    Added checks when entering text to verify that any virtual text is
    complete and valid.

    When building a list of avaiable widgets for a pane, look through all
    of the children and find any Add Widget actions to add to the list.

* lib/build.tcl
    Fixed a bug where building would cause the active component to go blank.

    Fixed a bug that would cause the status progressbar to disappear
    between platform builds.

* lib/BWidget/dialog.tcl
    Fixed a bug where closing the conditions window with the X would put the
    window into an unstable state.

* lib/Conditions/FileConditions/FilePermissionCondition.condition
    Added new "File Permission" condition to check file permissions.

* Themes/Modern_Wizard/Install/SelectionDestination.pane
* Themes/Classic_Wizard/Install/SelectionDestination.pane
    Added file permission condition to check and make sure we can create
    the install directory before proceeding.

* lib/conditions.tcl
    Preserve the geometry of the conditions window between sessions.


2005-11-14  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>

    	If info(ProjectDir) exists, we return that instead of a
	hard-coded path to InstallBase.  This will allow users
	more flexibility in specifying the location of projects.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Added in a search for some of the common browsers to list
	in the help browser list.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Changed the build log from a ListBox to a text box.  The ListBox
	gets too slow to scroll when the log starts getting big.

	EvalCondition doesn't evaluate from within the builder.  It always
	returns true.

    	InstallBase requires Tk upon start up.

    o lib/unpack.tcl
    	Unpack doesn't require Tk, but it requires a wait command.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Removed the LicenseFile and ReadmeFile options.  The text for each
	pane must be specified in the editor.

2003-03-09  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/common.tcl
    o lib/install.tcl

	Added the ability to specify the install.log location.

    o lib/main.tcl

2003-03-08  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    Giant commit.  Lots of changes.  This is only a short list of the
    high points.

    	Cleaned up a lot of code.

	Added the ability to change the Windows file icon of an install.

    	Removed freewrap binaries.

	Added TclKit binaries.

	Added rollback capabilities to installs.  When an install is
	cancelled, the files can be restored as they were before installation.

	Added a -S option to specify a silent install.

	Added a -Y option to specify an install where all defaults are
	accepted.

	Added a new version scheme which is different from the version string.

	Added Tablelist 3.0.

	Added BWidgets 1.6.

	Uninstall is now specified on a per-theme basis.  The panes of the
	uninstall can be specified just like an install.

	Changed the way platforms are named.  Many more platforms will be
	added to InstallBase shortly.

	Moved conditions into a subdirectory.  Each condition is defined
	as a separate script file.  This allows easy addition of user-
	defined conditions.

	Added balloons to projects to show last built and last saved.

	Added new progress bar code to allow for a lot more flexibility.
	This will eventually be put into install themes.

	Moved all preferences and options into trees.

	InstallBase now looks more like an XP application on XP.

2003-01-31  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/build.tcl
    	Removed some debugging code.

	Windows builds now build with a Tcl-only version of TclKit.  This
	saves us from loading Tk, which we don't need during a build.

    o lib/common.tcl
    	Re-wrote handling of progress during wrapping until TclKit can
	support on-the-fly compression.

    o lib/install.tcl
    	Unpack no longer builds its own binary, it simply uses the TclKit
	that's already there.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Added build time to log output after a build completes.

	When previewing a window with a progress bar, the progress bar
	updates in an infinite loop.

    o lib/windows.tcl
	Added some new keyboard shortcuts for several functions.

	Re-wrote the project preferences window to be more extensible in
	a tree.

2003-01-27  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o installbase
    	Removed checks for external version of wish.

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/main.tcl
    	Instead of withdrawing the root window, we hide it off screen.
	This allows us to make windows transient to the root window.

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/text.tcl
    	Added text for the readme buttons.

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/utils.tcl
    	Made all windows transient to .

    o lib/cmdline.tcl

    	Added a -Y option to uninstall to run without prompting the user.

	Added a -S option to silently uninstall with no windows.

    o lib/unpack.tcl

	Added some support for rollbacks.  Not complete yet.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Moved everything to TclKit.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Added some progress bars that are likely to change shortly.

2002-12-05  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o installbase.tcl
    o lib/main.tcl
    	Removed all functionality from this file and moved it to lib/main.tcl.

    o Binaries/Windows/freewrap.exe
    	Added a new freeWrap binary to fix a bug where files built with
	freewrap were coming out too large due to no files being removed.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	SetupPlatformBinaries checks to see if the freewrap we are using
	is newer than the freewish.  If it is, it replaces freewish.

2002-11-22  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/bwidget.tcl
    	We don't do all the BWidget setup if there are no image files.

    o lib/trees.tcl
    	Clear the selection in each tree before deleting everything.

    o lib/uninstall.tcl
    	Wait on the uninstall window.

2002-11-20  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/utils.tcl
    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/windows.tcl
    	Double-clicking a custom component will select it now.

    o lib/bwidget.tcl
    	If we've included any BWidgets in our install, we need to
	unpack all of the image files that we stored as well.

    o lib/uninstall.tcl
    	Added a '-S' option to the uninstall to silently uninstall
	without any message or windows.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	If we're storing BWidget files, store the entire BWidget image
	library with it.

2002-11-20  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/bwidget.tcl
    	Added more default commands to simulate some BWidget functionality.

    o lib/common.tcl
    	Be sure to delete the install.log itself when cleaning up a
	cancelled install.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Added a new option to allow inclusion of BWidget widget files
	directly into an install theme.  This removes the custom widget
	files included in the Classic Wizard theme in favor of the true
	BWidget files themselves.

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/windows.tcl
    	Added a borderwidth back to check boxes in the custom setup
	pane.  They weren't visible on a white background under UNIX.

2002-11-20  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/windows.tcl
    	Made "yes" the default answer in the popup window.

    o lib/uninstall.tcl
    	Made "yes" the default answer in the popup window.

    o lib/unpack.tcl
    	Re-ordered the final events of the unpack.  InstallBase
	would sometimes progress forward before unpack had written
	out the install log or finished its business.  This would
	cause the uninstall and KDE / Gnome dektop icons not to
	get made in most cases.

	Fixed a bug that would cause KDE and Gnome desktop icons
	(or any component for that matter) not to appear.

2002-11-20  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o installbase.tcl
    o lib/bwidget.tcl
    o lib/cmdline.tcl
    o lib/splash.tcl
    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Fixed a number of minor problems that would cause errors
	during command-line builds.

2002-11-19  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/utils.tcl
	Cleaned up some incompatibilities with Tcl 8.3.  I'm not
	quite ready to abandon 8.3 support.

	Fixed a bug in non-Windows platforms concerning testing
	with an available console.

2002-11-19  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o installbase.tcl
	Added auto-updating file groups.  Each file group can now be
	assigned a directory to check for file changes.  When the
	auto-update is run, InstallBase will check for new and deleted
	files and update the file group accordingly.

	Added an option to run auto-update upon loading a project.

    	Moved the load order around a little.

	If InstallBase cannot find a suitable platform binary, it now asks
	the user what platform they want to use.

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/utils.tcl
    	Added a command to register file groups and components when selecting
	a setup type.  This gives us a running list of actively selected
	file groups and components for later use.

    o lib/common.tcl
    	Moved several commands into the global namespace and made their
	names match their equivalent TclX command.

    o lib/components.tcl
    o lib/install.tcl
    	Added 'External Program' install component to execute external
	programs during installation.

    o lib/new.tcl
    	Store the current theme version in a new install.  This will stop
	InstallBase from thinking a new project's theme has changed.

    o lib/trees.tcl
    	Added autodir and autodirrecurse as variables to file groups.

	Fixed a bug where deleting files didn't decrement the size of the
	file group it was in.

	Added an entry to the right-click file menu to 'Explore' if the
	file group has an associated auto-update directory.  The file
	explorer will start in this directory.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Fixed a bug where some Solaris systems would sometime not
	calculate the version number properly, and InstallBase would
	think the user's platform binary didn't exist.

	Added a command to check for platform and prompt the user if
	no platform binary could be found.

	Added a command to run auto-update file group checks.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    o lib/windows.tcl
	Changed the options on the input window when adding new file
	groups.  If the user has selected to be prompted when a new
	file group is automatically created, they now get more options
	than just the install directory.

2002-11-03  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/install.tcl
    	Don't wrap applications with encryption.  This was causing a bug
	on installed Tcl files.  They were encrypted as they were laid
	down and they shouldn't have been.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Added a checkbox for auto-updating file lists, but they haven't
	been implemented yet.

2002-10-25  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/install.cfg
    	Added an option to display file groups in the custom setup pane.

	Added tree.tcl as a file to handle tree widgets.

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/listbox.tcl
    	Removed the BWidget headers, leaving on the listbox commands.

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/listbox.tcl
    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/windows.tcl
    	Re-wrote the way component and file group checks are handled in
	the custom setup pane.

	Selecting components and file groups will now properly update the
	size required field based on the selection.  Previously, if the
	same file group existed in two different components, and both
	components were checked, the size would reflect two copies of the
	file group.

	Added a Finish button to the view readme window.

    o lib/common.tcl
    	Added an option to display the console while installing under
	Windows.

	Fixed a bug where InstallBase would try to cleanup an install
	that it hadn't even started installing.

    o lib/help.tcl
    	Added some commands to handle images in help documentation.

	Added a command to handle the HTML title tag and adjust the
	title of the help window accordingly.


    o lib/install.tcl
    	Changed the way components and file groups in a custom setup
	are recognized and installed.

	Fixed a bug where if a file group were selected more than once,
	files would be installed more than once.  Now, files only
	install once regardless of how many times a particular file
	group is selected.

	Removed blank.zip from InstallBase.  With the new ::freewrap::wrap
	command, it is superfluous.  This will decrease the size of all
	installs by 100k.

	Cleaned up all the code that used blank.zip.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Added IncludeBWidgetHeaders proc to determine if the install
	we're building needs some standard BWidget header files.  This
	makes including BWidgets in installs really easy by simply
	copying the file containing the widget you want.

	Fixed a bug where components and file groups were being ordered
	incorrectly in an install.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Added a menu option under the Help menu to go right to the tutorial.

	Added an option under Windows to show the Tcl console during
	installation for debugging purposes.

2002-10-21  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/common.tcl
    o lib/components.tcl
    o lib/install.tcl
    o lib/uninstall.tcl
    	Added an option to forcefully uninstall a directory when adding
	a Directory Uninstall Component.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Made the build log window auto-scroll as new entries are added.

	The build log window doesn't clear itself with every build, only
	when a project is closed.

	Increased the default dimensions of the build log window.

2002-10-18  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o Binaries/Windows/freewrap.exe
	Fixed a bug that would cause incorrect CRCs on stored files.

    o lib/new.tcl
    	Pick a default project name when creating a new project.

	The current platform is automatically selected when creating a
	new project.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    o lib/windows.tcl
	Added a new option to only repack the files InstallBase uses for
	its installation instead of always rebuilding the entire install.
	This makes for much faster subsequent builds when all the files
	in the install don't need to be re-compressed.  Very useful for
	testing install changes.

2002-10-17  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/help.tcl
    	If a help browser is not available on the current platform, notify
	the user and tell them to choose a web browser.

2002-10-17  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/windows.tcl
    o lib/help.tcl
    	Added the option to specify the web browser to use when browsing
	help files.  The default, 'Internal Browser', will use InstallBase's
	internal browser.

    o lib/common.tcl
    	Fixed some bugs in uninstalling directories.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Fixed a bug that would cause errors while loading a project if
	no .installbaserc file existed.

    o lib/help/VirtualDirectories.html
    o lib/help/VirtualText.html
    	Finished up the last of making the help files generic and easily
	readable by any web browser.

2002-10-15  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/editor.tcl
    	Cleaned up the editor's look a little.  Centered upon creation.

    o lib/trees.tcl
    	Changed a lot of the selection, check and uncheck code in the
	Component and Setup Type trees.

	A double-click now checks and unchecks a selected node.

	Added 'Check' and 'Uncheck' options to the right-click menu
	under the Component and Setup Type trees that will check and
	uncheck a range of nodes at once.

	Added selection commands to the right-click menus for the
	Component and Setup Type menus.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Fixed a bug that was removing the last character of a string
	in the editor.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Added a bunch of menu options for the Component and Setup Type menus.

2002-10-14  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o installbase.tcl
    	Added option to prompt for directories when adding new file groups.

	Require BWidget 1.4.2 (which doesn't really exist, it's ours).

    o Binaries/Windows/freewrap.exe
    	Added a new freeWrap binary for Windows that fixes a bug that would
	occur when adding shortcuts with foreign characters in the path.

	Added some new Windows commands which will be used later.

    o Theme/Classic_Wizard/install.cfg
    	Added a new property to some of the panes to specify which buttons
	to be displayed in the pane.

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/install.cfg
    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/text.tcl
	Added a new text field for each button in the panes.

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/windows.tcl
    	Removed specific options to NavButtons commands throughout.
	These are now specified through the pane options.

    o lib/common.tcl
    	NavButtons now checks for the Buttons property for a window.

	Windows registry keys are now logged with their values as well.
	
	When uninstalling a Windows registry key, the value will be removed,
	and if the key is empty, it will be removed as well.

    o lib/components.tcl
    	Added an option to Wrapped Applications to remove InstallBase
	components from the wrapped application.

	Added the ability to uninstall a specific value of a Windows
	registry key.

    o lib/install.tcl
    	Fixed a bug where Windows XP installs were failing trying to
	obtain user information during initialization.

    o lib/trees.tcl
    	Added 'Add as Wrapped Application' option to File Group menu.

    o lib/uninstall.tcl
    	Added a specific command for each component to be uninstalled.

	installation cleanup.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Added option to prompt for directories when adding new file groups.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Made the project preferences frame a single procedure to be called

    o installbase.tcl
    	Added option to cleanup a cancelled install.

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/utils.tcl
    	When an install is cancelled, we need to call ::MPI::CancelInstall
	to make it official.

    o Theme/Classic_Wizard/windows.tcl
    	Added new virtual text for the User Information pane in the
	Classic Wizard: <UserName>, <UserCompany> and <UserSerial>.

    o lib/common.tcl
    	Added functions to cleanup a cancelled install.

	Changed the way DirIsWritable works slightly.  Should give
	more accurate results on Windows.

	Added <Temp> as a virtual directory to use InstallBase's temporary
	directory during installation.

    o lib/help.tcl
    	Help can be called with a window and tab.

    o lib/install.tcl

    o lib/trees.tcl
    	Added some catches due to some erroneous errors under 8.4.

	to think it was still building when it wasn't.

	Added a check to see if a build was in progress before closing
	a project.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Cleaned up transience on all of the windows in the builder.
	There were some inconsistencies with Tcl 8.4.

	The delete key now deletes install components.

2002-09-27  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    	Moved the InstallBase theme into the preferences array.

    o lib/components.tcl
    	Added buttons to move components in the Install Components list.

    	Added buttons to move components in the Install Components list.

    o lib/help/
    	Updated help documents to be more generic so that they can
	potentially work in any web browser.

    o lib/help/About.tcl
    	Added credits to the about help.

    o lib/Tablelist
    	Upgraded to Tablelist 2.8.

2002-09-23  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/new.tcl
    	Fixed a bug that was causing new projects to fail.

    o lib/trees.tcl
    	Fixed a bug that would cause new file group additions to fail.

    o lib/utils.tcl

	group tab.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Added a preferences window under the "File" menu.

	Moved InstallBase theme selection into the preferences window.

2002-09-12  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>
    o lib/convert.tcl
    	Added a proc to determine if the theme in use has a new version
	and convert it if necessary.

	entry sometimes.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Added a prompt to ask the user if they want to restore the install
	theme if the project was converted during load.

2002-08-20  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o installbase.tcl
    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/install.cfg
    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/utils.tcl
    	Removed the Program Executable option from the Classic Wizard
	theme and made it a standard variable for each platform.

	Added some help to some of the properties.

    o lib/common.tcl
    	Turned on condition checking for install components.  It was
	curiously absent until now. 0-]

	File added to InstallBase.  This file will contain commands specific
	to determining conditions during installation.

    o lib/common.tcl
	Added 'EvalCondition' command to evaluate a given condition and return
	a 1 or 0.

	Added a check in "Window show" to check a given window's condition
	before displaying it.

    o lib/utils.tcl
	Removed remaining references to WindowsAware and SmartSetupTypes.

	Added conditions.tcl to the install build.

	Made the Properties tab in Install Panes a scrollable frame to
	accomodate for increasingly long property lists.

	Currently empty.

	Added 'ConditionComboBox' command to give a default means of displaying
	a combobox of conditions.

2002-06-01  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o installbase.tcl
    	Changed the way default options are set.  Now, if we add an option
	and an old project doesn't have it, it will receive the default
	value the next time it is loaded.

	Added the AutoFileGroups project preference.

    o lib/new.tcl
    	Force the loading of the default options when creating a new project.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Added the ability to create new file groups when adding directory
	structures.

	Added some commands to convert all Windows filenames to their longname
	equivalent.  It just looks nicer.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Added the AutoFileGroups option.

2002-06-01  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/text.tcl
    o lib/windows.tcl
	In anticipation of its inevitable release, MPI has been renamed to
	InstallBase MPI.

2002-05-31  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o mpi.tcl
    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/install.cfg
    	Moved Program Executable and Readme into the theme instead of
	platform options.

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/utils.tcl
    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/windows.tcl
    	When setting the program folder, we need to set the directory as well.

    o lib/components.tcl
    	When setting the script in a wrapped binary, we want to set the
	scriptname exactly.  If we're on Windows, this means getting the
	true longname of the file.

	Added proc to add a shortcut.

    o lib/install.tcl
    	Re-wrote AddShortcut to conform to the new method.

    o lib/new.tcl
    	Fixed a problem that occurred if there was only one platform.

    o lib/unpack.tcl
    	Fixed a bug where wrapped applications were progressing incorrectly.

	Fixed a bug where if a file existed, we were incrementing the wrong
	file size.  This caused a progressbar overflow in some cases.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Fixed some problems with background building.

	Added a check to see if a project is modified before testing.

	Added RestoreTheme to restore the original theme of a project.

	Added SaveTheme to save the current install as a new theme.

2002-05-28  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/components.tcl
    o lib/install.tcl
    	Added "Uninstall Component" component.

    o lib/trees.tcl
    	Added the ability to delete file groups, components and setup types.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Added some new buttons for the delete functions.

2002-05-28  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/windows.tcl
    	Moved the text for the background window over.

    o lib/common.tcl
    	Moved CreateDir and CreateDirTree to common.tcl.

    o lib/components.tcl
    	Added return key shortcuts for each component.
	
	Added AddFolder.

    o lib/install.tcl
    	Had to re-write some extraction code owing to the fact that MPI's
	files are now stored under a directory instead of in the root
	directory.

    o lib/trees.tcl
    	Almost done adding delete routines for Setup Types and Components.

	Fixed a bug where each time a project was loaded, the size of the
	file groups would compound.

    o lib/unpack.tcl
    	If a file is zero-byte, we don't need to try and copy it.  This would
	cause a hang during unpack.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Install builds are now a backgrounded process.  This will allow the
	user to continue to work even during a build.  Still need to add
	some checks though.

	MPI's install files no longer get zipped in after the initial install
	file is created.  This causes a much longer build time on installs
	of very large sizes.

	Fixed some bugs that cropped up when MPI was placed in a directory
	structure that had spaces in the name.

2002-05-23  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>
    o lib/common.tcl
    	Moved the creation of the install log to the exit routine.  This
	ensures that the install log will always contain anything added as
	it's the last thing to happen before exit.

	Added 'VersionWeight' command which, when given a version number,
	will determine a weight and return it.  This is used to compare
	versions during installation.  1.4b1 is higher than 1.4a4, etc...

2002-05-23  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>
    o lib/utils.tcl
	Re-wrote Filename procedure to be compatible with 8.3

    o lib/unpack.tcl
	Added a run log file.  Something on Windows 2000 was causing longer
	installs to lock-up for some reason.  Not sure why, but this seems
	to fix it.  Gotta' love Windows.

	Removed some safety checks to speed up install time.	

2002-05-06  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Switched from mclistbox to Csaba Nemethi's Tablelist widget.  It's
	bigger but a lot nicer-looking and more full-featured.

2002-04-26  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o mpi.tcl
    	Added a section for install components on the build list.

    o lib/common.tcl
    	Added 'InstallComponents' proc to do the installation of components.
	Used by both the installer and the unpacker.

    o lib/components.tcl
    	Added a whole bunch of stuff and made components pretty-well work.

    o lib/install.tcl
    o lib/unpack.tcl
    	Made the installer and unpacker actually conform to the new way of
	doing components.

2002-04-23  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/mpi.tcl
    	Removed the code for a Tcl-specific window.  It's now all done
	through a generic "component" interface.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    o lib/windows.tcl
      Removed a lot of code that was dealing with the Tcl-specific options
      tab.

2002-04-13  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/trees.tcl
    o lib/utils.tcl
    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Hooked up the explorer button under Windows.  Since we now have
	drag-n-drop support, we just use Windows Explorer.

2002-04-13  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/unpack.tcl
    	Fixed a bug where InstallDir wasn't being created on an install
	where we wrap the entire project.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Fixed some crazy bug that doesn't happen under Tcl 8.3 but does
	happen under Tcl 8.4.  When building an install, if we rename
	the file before we wrap the other install files into it, we get
	a "file exists" error every other build when trying to rename
	the file.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Removed the preferences window in favor of doing preferences in
	each project.  I've always hated the way preferences are defined
	globally.  Some projects are different than others.

2002-04-10  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o mpi.tcl
    	Added the platform binaries directory to the auto_path.

    o lib/help.tcl
    	Added the beginnings of a help system using a mini-browser built from
	TkHtml.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Added a read_file proc.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Added initial help topics to the build windows.

2002-04-09  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/unpack.tcl
    	All directories are created in path order.  This ensures we never
	accidentally delete a subdirectory we didn't create.

    o lib/uninstall.tcl
    	Cleaned up the display of error details.

2002-04-09  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/common.tcl
    o lib/unpack.tcl
        Moved the info commands into common.tcl.

	Added some functions to cleanup temporary MPI directories left on a
	system.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Added keyboard shortcuts to the Platform Options window.

2002-04-08  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/windows.tcl
    o lib/install.tcl
    o lib/unpack.tcl

	scripts.

	Checking an app as Tcl or not toggles the Tcl tab.

    o mpi.tcl
    	Added a check to see if the MPI itself is wrapped.

    o lib/install.tcl

    	Added the option of overwriting files if they have a newer version.

2002-02-09  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/install.tcl
    	Added a versioning system.  If enabled, we store the product version
	with each filename so that we can update later based on versions.

2002-02-08  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o lib/trees.tcl
    	Added popup menus for all of the component trees.

    o lib/windows.tcl

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	Removed . from pane list operations.

	Added the ability to disable previewing of a window.

	Added a check for a default.tcl file in each theme.  If it exists,

2002-02-06  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/windows.tcl
    	Added a cancel button to the Copy Files window.

    o lib/install.tcl
    	Added a routine to check the writability of a directory.
	[file writable] doesn't quite work on directories under Windows.

	Fixed up the progressbar a little.  It wasn't handling different
	widths properly.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	When storing pane lists, we always want to store .

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Commented out the 'Total Size' entry until I figure out what I want
	to do with it.

2002-02-05  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

	platforminfo.

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/text.tcl
    	Added text fields for the checkbuttons on the Setup Complete screen.

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/theme.cfg
    	Disabled some windows by default.  We now only store windows in the

	can by default.

	Added text fields for the checkbuttons in Setup Complete.

    o Themes/Classic_Wizard/windows.tcl
	Added a new button in Setup Complete to add a desktop icon.

	Added text fields for the checkbuttons in Setup Complete.

	given is valid (ie: writable).

    o lib/new.tcl

	be stored for use within the install.  This file will not be overwritten
	if the default theme is restored to the install.

    o lib/utils.tcl
    	We now only store window procs based on which windows are enabled in
	the install.  This means installs are somewhat smaller if the window
	list is smaller.

	Added 'PaneList' proc to return a list of the current panes.

	Added the ability to choose either a static or dynamic build when
	building an install.

	Made more windows transient to the proper window instead of just .

	can now be renamed successfully.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Fixed a bug where the delete button was calling the wrong command.

	Fixed bug where windows deleted weren't unsetting conf(window).

    o lib/install.tcl
    	SubstText can now subst for Windows special directories.

    o lib/trees.tcl
    	Added some more Modified commands.

    o lib/utils.tcl
	Use InstallDir and Executable based on platforms instead of just a
	universal one.

	Changed all the tk_* commands to mpi_* commands.  This gives us a
	way to set default values and options for each command.

	We now destroy .build at each Close.  This is so it can be re-created
	with platform-specific information with each new project.

    o lib/windows.tcl
    	Removed Executable and InstallDir options.

	Added new build section for Platform Options.

    o lib/widgets.tcl
	Added widgets.tcl to define MPI-specific widget commands.

2001-03-14  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

    This entry is mostly just for posterity.  I didn't start keeping
    a change log until much later on in the development of InstallBase,
    but this is, in fact, the date that it all started on.  The first
    log entry would not come until almost a year later.
