1.2.14 (October 1st, 2009)

This release contains minor bug fixes and enhancements.


Minor Bug Fixes
Fixed a bug where excluding a parent component could cause an error to happen when loading the child component in the installer.
Fixed a bug where selecting Update File Text on the Install Selected Files action would cause the wrong messages to be displayed during a console install.  Console installs do not support per-file installation progress at this time.

Minor Enhancements
An uninstaller will now prompt for a root password if it needs to.
Prompt for root password will no longer work in console or silent mode.  Instead, the (un)installer issues a message that the program require root and then exits.  If a suitable graphical utility can be found to prompt for the root password, it will still do so in GUI mode.
Messages to the console will no longer include any title text.  Previously, messages looked like "Root Required: This program requires root."  The "Root Required: " part is no longer displayed for console messages.
Added a new Exit Actions action group that executes as the last set of actions as the installer goes to exit.  This action group is the last place to insert your own actions and happens just before the temporary directory is cleaned off the disk.
